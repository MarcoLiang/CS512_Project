{"abstract": "In this paper, we tackle a novel type of interesting queries - shortest unique substring queries. Given a (long) string S and a query point q in the string, can we find a shortest substring containing q that is unique in S? We illustrate that shortest unique substring queries have many potential applications, such as information retrieval, bioinformatics, and event context analysis. We develop efficient algorithms for online query answering. First, we present an algorithm to answer a shortest unique substring query in O(n) time using a suffix tree index, where n is the length of string S. Second, we show that, using O(n\u00b7h) time and O(n) space, we can compute a shortest unique substring for every position in a given string, where h is variable theoretically in O(n) but on real data sets often much smaller than n and can be treated as a constant. Once the shortest unique substrings are pre-computed, shortest unique substring queries can be answered online in constant time. In addition to the solid algorithmic results, we empirically demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of shortest unique substring queries on real data sets.", "authors": ["Jian Pei", "W.

{"abstract": "Traditionally, stemming has been applied to Information Retrieval tasks by transforming words in documents to the their root form before indexing, and applying a similar transformation to query terms. Although it increases recall, this naive strategy does not work well for Web Search since it lowers precision and requires a significant amount of additional computation.   In this paper, we propose a context sensitive stemming method that addresses these two issues. Two unique properties make our approach feasible for Web Search. First, based on statistical language modeling, we perform context sensitive analysis on the query side. We accurately predict which of its morphological variants is useful to expand a query term with before submitting the query to the search engine. This dramatically reduces the number of bad expansions, which in turn reduces the cost of additional computation and improves the precision at the same time. Second, our approach performs a context sensitive document matching for those expanded variants. This conservative strategy serves as a safeguard against spurious stemming, and it turns out to be very important for improving precision. Using word pluralization handling as an example of our stemming approach, our experiments on a major Web search engine show that stemming only 29% of the query traffic, we can improve relevance as measured by average Discounted Cumulative Gain (DCG5) by 6.1% on these queriesand 1.8% over all query traffic.", "authors": ["Fuchun Peng", "Nawaaz Ahmed", "Xin Li", "Yumao Lu"], "references": ["0895c22d-37c5-4c8f-9202-a32ebd2cb0c0", "0b01c598-4c0b-45f8-bd9f-549b2bfc7bf8", "0dd0b476-dfd1-4ffa-96c8-06e8700693b3", "0f205586-1755-4e68-8bbf-548178719462", "1e396e2f-0684-4625-baf9-a9b186b6a474", "1ef6d076-e82f-4bdd-8d8b-ee669a056de8", "2b573516-5439-41bf-97de-0669df91d17c", "3be90fee-1372-4485-ac6c-e110e7e0e093", "64b81ce2-c675-49cd-a653-ff5ddaa5105d", "75e7e32a-cdd8-4516-af48-cfde68f7ef76", "bedffcd4-e9a7-4a88-af10-81e012c61063", "c4e97bd5-5db5-4a85-b165-1f644ebb8f78", "ce2a2fa1-d278-443a-870c-28aae29cc9aa", "e52ca406-8e6c-434d-b81e-eb133f35c936", "ed8f96b0-dd29-4a5d-8af6-dc1d3ae400a6", "fa522e46-b194-4a90-a872-14fbb5903869", "facd0902-9e7f-41eb-ab2e-ab7205265c98"], "title": "Context sensitive stemming for web search", "venue": "international acm sigir conference on research and development in information retrieval", "year": 2007, "id": "4bdf6540-6a88-4af8-a9dd-3d837eb44a43"}
{"abstract": "Shortest path queries (SPQ) are essential in many graph analysis and mining tasks. However, answering shortest path queries on-the-fly on large graphs is costly. To online answer shortest path queries, we may materialize and index shortest paths. However, a straightforward index of all shortest paths in a graph of  N  vertices takes  O ( N  2 ) space. In this paper, we tackle the problem of indexing shortest paths and online answering shortest path queries. As many large real graphs are shown richly symmetric, the central idea of our approach is to use graph symmetry to reduce the index size while retaining the correctness and the efficiency of shortest path query answering. Technically, we develop a framework to index a large graph at the orbit level instead of the vertex level so that the number of breadth-first search trees materialized is reduced from  O ( N ) to  O (|\u0394|), where |\u0394| \u2264  N  is the number of orbits in the graph. We explore orbit adjacency and local symmetry to obtain compact breadth-first-search trees (compact BFS-trees). An extensive empirical study using both synthetic data and real data shows that compact BFS-trees can be built efficiently and the space cost can be reduced substantially. Moreover, online shortest path query answering can be achieved using compact BFS-trees.", "authors": ["Yanghua Xiao", "Wentao Wu", "Jian Pei", "Wei Wang", "Zhenying He"], "references": ["13003906-6692-435a-9b31-25093c78d00e", "17475ac2-3f81-4df8-b407-34ae8cc6a792", "229fb1ab-31bd-4065-98a8-fa231dffba71", "30e729be-1b6d-4814-ac81-6669e1e87581", "362f16f0-4494-4f18-a9b8-f64fe83a50d8", "374b62aa-c6d1-4540-baa6-bd91a8f1bc39", "3fe346d3-5a15-4d14-9363-24f402d474a3", "409159cc-0393-4021-99ee-654018eb0fa4", "5f896ce3-4d8c-4120-968f-b46e651e073f", "813d3862-59eb-48ec-b378-602ae80ecc2d", "8972715c-4b5b-4cf5-94e7-805d5e5a9d4a", "da40d3db-d3e3-46d4-b632-7e510f118b13", "feaac7d9-cebc-4ac8-bba1-976ab606fe81"], "title": "Efficiently indexing shortest paths by exploiting symmetry in graphs", "venue": "extending database technology", "year": 2009, "id": "4c41ca8f-30cf-4228-afd4-de3834fc827c"}

{"abstract": "By comparing genomes among both closely and distally related species,  comparative genomics analysis  characterizes structures and functions of different genomes in both conserved and divergent regions. Synteny blocks, which are conserved blocks of genes on chromosomes of related species, play important roles in comparative genomics analysis. Although a few tools have been designed to identify synteny blocks, most of them cannot handle some challenging application requirements, particularly the strandedness of genes, gene inversions, gene duplications, and comparison of more than two genomes. We developed a data mining tool, Ortho-Cluster, which can handle all those challenges. It is publicly available at http://genome.sfu.ca/projects/orthocluster. OrthoCluster takes the annotated gene sets of candidate genomes and pairwise orthologous relationships as input and efficiently identifies the complete set of synteny blocks. In addition, OrthoCluster identifies four types of genome rearrangement events namely inversion, transposition, insertion/deletion, and reciprocal translocation. To be fleexible in various application scenarios, OrthoCluster comes with a systematic set of parameters such as the synteny block size, number of mismatches allowed, whether the strandedness is enforced, whether gene ordering is preserved. Furthermore, OrthoCluster can be used to identify segmental duplication in a genome. In this paper, we introduce the major technical ideas, and present some interesting findings using OrthoCluster.", "authors": ["Xinghuo Zeng", "Matthew J.

{"abstract": "A Cyber-Physical System (CPS) integrates physical devices (e.g., sensors, cameras) with cyber (or informational) components to form a situation-integrated analytical system that may respond intelligently to dynamic changes of the real-world situations. CPS claims many promising applications, such as traffic observation, battlefield surveillance and sensor-network based monitoring. One important research topic in CPS is about the atypical event analysis, i.e., retrieving the events from large amount of data and analyzing them with spatial, temporal and other multi-dimensional information. Many traditional approaches are not feasible for such analysis since they use numeric measures and cannot describe the complex atypical events. In this study, we propose a new model of atypical cluster to effectively represent those events and efficiently retrieve them from massive data. The micro-cluster is designed to summarize individual events, and the macro-cluster is used to integrate the information from multiple event. To facilitate scalable, flexible and online analysis, the concept of significant cluster is defined and a guided clustering algorithm is proposed to retrieve significant clusters in an efficient manner.

{"abstract": "With the explosion in the amount of semi-structured data users access and store in personal information management systems, there is a need for complex search tools to retrieve often very heterogeneous data in a simple and efficient way. Existing tools usually index text content, allowing for some IR-style ranking on the textual part of the query, but only consider structure (e.g., file directory) and metadata (e.g., date, file type) as filtering conditions. We propose a novel multi-dimensional approach to semi-structured data searches in personal information management systems by allowing users to provide fuzzy structure and metadata conditions in addition to keyword conditions. Our techniques provide a complex query interface that is more comprehensive than content-only searches as it considers three query dimensions (content, structure, metadata) in the search. We propose techniques to individually score each dimension, as well as a framework to integrate the three dimension scores into a meaningful unified score. Our work is integrated in Wayfinder, an existing fully-functioning file system. We perform a thorough experimental evaluation of our techniques to show the effect of approximating individual dimensions on the overall scores and ranks of files, as well as on query performance. Our experiments show that our scoring strategy adequately takes into account the approximation in each dimension to efficiently evaluate fuzzy multi-dimensional queries. In addition, fuzzy query conditions in non-content dimensions can significantly improve scoring (and thus ranking) accuracy.", "authors": ["Christopher Peery", "Wei Wang", "Am\u00e9lie Marian", "Thu D.

{"abstract": "Traditional multi-dimensional data analysis techniques such as iceberg cube cannot be directly applied to graphs for finding interesting or anomalous vertices due to the lack of dimensionality in graphs. In this paper, we introduce the concept of graph icebergs that refer to vertices for which the concentration (aggregation) of an attribute in their vicinities is abnormally high. Intuitively, these vertices shall be \u201cclose\u201d to the attribute of interest in the graph space. Based on this intuition, we propose a novel framework, called gIceberg, which performs aggregation using random walks, rather than traditional SUM and AVG aggregate functions. This proposed framework scores vertices by their different levels of interestingness and finds important vertices that meet a user-specified threshold. To improve scalability, two aggregation strategies, forward and backward aggregation, are proposed with corresponding optimization techniques and bounds. Experiments on both real-world and synthetic large graphs demonstrate that gIceberg is effective and scalable.", "authors": ["Nan Li", "Ziyu Guan", "Lijie Ren", "Jian Wu", "Jiawei Han", "Xifeng Yan"], "references": ["05fadb61-949a-4984-8559-d12a51202c8d", "1994f74c-bf49-40b3-afc9-53914bde82ac", "25c095f6-6a7c-4046-952a-ce0c6d2fe4e4", "294930bb-63db-42a3-994f-07c6fd4ce50a", "3fc30b9e-1232-4136-978a-188ef482ab39", "4647fc76-7e1e-4447-91c0-3a8938dfba7f", "4d13d946-9cda-4621-ba6d-d78d7140e0c4", "4d6d1c1c-2962-4df0-9559-856442dfba1d", "4f362ece-bab3-48dc-b210-dc0336500684", "541eccbc-eb59-405d-b4c5-2001b00242cc", "615c5d3b-e1e6-4c4e-92f9-d117f134ef4d", "6415d03e-6198-44d4-9ca7-4308cab5ba7f", "6dd9da89-a40a-4cb3-b719-c39193fa6d3d", "819a25ea-1a88-42e2-a830-d423c06927e7", "853abefd-cff2-4958-835f-0ab5cb11db88", "854fac6a-4f3a-4145-b91d-53bb8829dc3c", "aa56a2b6-fc03-4550-aa69-6e10efc56474", "b7872d2f-c3a2-49d2-a279-4a9976a28349", "ca1d3032-e288-42f1-9228-f95da0535c0c", "ccc5cb4e-4af9-44b4-b510-d87bea1e4500", "ddce6d49-0271-4ad5-b42b-78298f543e76", "e52d8427-e44c-4ff8-a584-4c8033cf5a55", "f47a1d0c-202f-4f0b-952a-042d4d3a2734", "f6326c6d-6313-43fb-a028-5bfe5cf3505c", "f9b3532e-fb6d-4719-9d09-4a9d546159ef", "fabf6595-1331-4f1a-a6e0-24e1001a1fe7", "fd3211f0-d5f4-4da3-9e4a-3408ffbbcb63"], "title": "gIceberg: Towards iceberg analysis in large graphs", "venue": "international conference on data engineering", "year": 2013, "id": "5303af85-8f37-4621-b120-f81fbdc2b916"}
{"abstract": "TextRank is a variant of PageRank typically used in graphs that represent documents, and where vertices denote terms and edges denote relations between terms. Quite often the relation between terms is simple term co-occurrence within a fixed window of  k  terms. The output of TextRank when applied iteratively is a score for each vertex, i.e. a term weight, that can be used for information retrieval (IR) just like conventional term frequency based term weights.   So far, when computing TextRank term weights over co-occurrence graphs, the window of term co-occurrence is always fixed. This work departs from this, and considers dynamically adjusted windows of term co-occurrence that follow the document structure on a sentence- and paragraph-level. The resulting TextRank term weights are used in a ranking function that re-ranks 1000 initially returned search results in order to improve the precision of the ranking. Experiments with two IR collections show that adjusting the vicinity of term co-occurrence when computing TextRank term weights can lead to gains in early precision.", "authors": ["Wei Lu", "Qikai Cheng", "Christina Lioma"], "references": ["1ff045fa-9bc1-4406-aa0f-aea6e33beba7", "36117a7c-0a75-4dd8-be85-c8ec66ab749e", "6777708d-519d-4da1-a509-194492593dcc", "9a283296-4db9-4c79-a9e2-77e26395b4e8", "ea416cb9-c5b8-4bb6-9790-93f25c1b2e3f"], "title": "Fixed versus dynamic co-occurrence windows in TextRank term weights for information retrieval", "venue": "international acm sigir conference on research and development in information retrieval", "year": 2012, "id": "54720518-9226-4eeb-bfe5-8b1000e7d45e"}
{"abstract": "Many new applications that involve decision making need online ( i.e ., OLAP-styled) preference analysis with multidimensional Boolean selections. Typical preference queries includes top- k  queries and skyline queries. An analytical query often comes with a set of Boolean predicates that constrain a target subset of data, which, may also vary incrementally by drilling/rolling operators. To efficiently support preference queries with multiple boolean predicates, neither  Boolean-then-preference   nor   preference-then-Boolean  approach is satisfactory. To integrate Boolean pruning and preference pruning in a unified framework, we propose  signature,  a new materialization measure for multi-dimensional group-bys. Based on this, we propose  P-Cube  ( i.e. , data cube for preference queries) and study its complete life cycle, including signature generation, compression, decomposition, incremental maintenance and usage for efficient on-line analytical query processing. We present a signature-based progressive algorithm that is able to simultaneously push boolean and preference constraints deep into the database search.

{"abstract": "All pairs similarity search, used in many data mining and information retrieval applications, is a time consuming process. Although a partition-based approach accelerates this process by simplifying parallelism management and avoiding unnecessary I/O and comparison, it is still challenging to balance the computation load among parallel machines with a distributed architecture. This is mainly due to the variation in partition sizes and irregular dissimilarity relationship in large datasets. This paper presents a two-stage heuristic algorithm to improve the load balance and shorten the overall processing time. We analyze the optimality and competitiveness of the proposed algorithm and demonstrates its effectiveness using several datasets. We also describe a static partitioning algorithm to even out the partition sizes while detecting more dissimilar pairs.

{"abstract": "In recent years, many new applications, such as sensor network monitoring and moving object search, show a growing amount of importance of uncertain data management and mining. In this paper, we study the problem of discovering threshold-based frequent closed item sets over probabilistic data. Frequent item set mining over probabilistic database has attracted much attention recently. However, existing solutions may lead an exponential number of results due to the downward closure property over probabilistic data. Moreover, it is hard to directly extend the successful experiences from mining exact data to a probabilistic environment due to the inherent uncertainty of data. Thus, in order to obtain a reasonable result set with small size, we study discovering frequent closed item sets over probabilistic data. We prove that even a sub-problem of this problem, computing the frequent closed probability of an item set, is #P-Hard. Therefore, we develop an efficient mining algorithm based on depth-first search strategy to obtain all probabilistic frequent closed item sets. To reduce the search space and avoid redundant computation, we further design several probabilistic pruning and bounding techniques. Finally, we verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed methods through extensive experiments.", "authors": ["Yongxin Tong", "Lei Chen", "Bolin Ding"], "references": ["0215b4b2-e722-48ac-bb8e-acd3fd75c206", "0cbb8a06-52b1-4117-a5af-79ebe41ff0de", "1bda9568-7aec-41c7-9b1b-8e4825fcd4d1", "32821332-fd22-4418-8cab-79d88fbe3e37", "32c06c20-e5c5-47bf-80d5-fdbfba0bb39e", "4388f138-8b70-45c7-890a-18ccc4390e2b", "4b35cd90-8b1d-415f-b9d4-5dfd6249ade4", "4c067898-b40c-4a88-90a7-cc6ce117e452", "4c53f2f0-1838-4864-8f23-d9618972f01f", "4e1c1097-2393-4b1b-a89a-72753eb30e3d", "58bde0a6-18ff-4d37-b4c2-f877f69d3e49", "6413d2ad-2e0b-432c-b5d0-2d49244fde24", "7f2b8397-c89d-414f-9ae8-a71f3c7e18e6", "990758f0-74a1-48ce-bc92-ae5bc81a15c1", "9c2df6e5-b1f2-49b5-ba84-2e76a7d86cd1", "a9764584-f538-4b79-88ce-2ab0d3d63044", "ac1c1f38-5d5c-4628-864a-1c3cd628f695", "ad1237c5-7c27-494b-955b-fd9b878af6c9", "bc1a6a78-c0c8-4a95-9e0d-372e87e30470", "c4710c73-497d-44f0-ae10-64613eca18d4", "c80e9ce4-9af2-48fd-9b87-07d4bfe97bcc", "d1dcc639-060f-419e-8ef5-16d05b290692", "ddbb6065-959e-42e2-967f-085a28b5b74d", "de69603b-8ce2-46c3-86cd-d16349970ac8", "ecd6a845-8439-49b0-abe8-f71fff81da23", "f992a74d-3183-4b98-af86-9f8318ff5a5c", "fdb4daf0-bfb9-43cf-ac7f-b08ea40a435b", "ff7c85e0-90dc-4050-b987-095580f4e3eb"], "title": "Discovering Threshold-based Frequent Closed Itemsets over Probabilistic Data", "venue": "international conference on data engineering", "year": 2012, "id": "5ba613b3-a957-4b67-b204-6219257246d1"}
{"abstract": "In a wide array of disciplines, data can be modeled as an interconnected network of entities, where various attributes could be associated with both the entities and the relations among them. Knowledge is often hidden in the complex structure and attributes inside these networks. While querying and mining these linked datasets are essential for various applications, traditional graph queries may not be able to capture the rich semantics in these networks. With the advent of complex information networks, new graph queries are emerging, including graph pattern matching and mining, similarity search, ranking and expert finding, graph aggregation and OLAP. These queries require both the topology and content information of the network data, and hence, different from classical graph algorithms such as shortest path, reach ability and minimum cut, which depend only on the structure of the network. In this tutorial, we shall give an introduction of the emerging graph queries, their indexing and resolution techniques, the current challenges and the future research directions.", "authors": ["Arijit Khan", "Yinghui Wu", "Xifeng Yan"], "references": ["092f7a25-720a-4f43-946a-a37879601159", "0ac5e875-88a7-4b5f-b998-01cd9a25752e", "0de74e0f-9caa-4c14-b4ec-4804ecd5ad11", "1234ba1e-e979-4304-ba8b-92eef14c5c27", "13c45b01-88bc-4d1e-8a13-b1eabc6daeb4", "1549ef78-ef21-4af0-aa0b-dceadbc19952", "16e059dc-703b-49c7-913f-57b0bff5b57b", "1927f5a6-6b9c-4343-bb06-cf89947e0080", "1a7f332a-4bd2-432b-b7ad-9a0d689aa1cc", "1e5fda69-7320-4c9f-b4c0-09324ab26c31", "229fb1ab-31bd-4065-98a8-fa231dffba71", "2314fcb1-34dd-4322-a5b3-223ae3cf257c", "28844d30-dba6-46c2-9d0f-994da8f0397b", "2c490022-8325-49ae-a129-652d9664451d", "3035820e-76c4-4400-9474-709fe5331a68", "376e716d-b067-47b2-b091-b8e6c879ba19", "4c41ca8f-30cf-4228-afd4-de3834fc827c", "51cfdd10-1566-4380-adae-3889630ebaf4", "5e18b080-f20f-4e5a-b3e3-847b6fbc5c86", "5eb26ec4-096d-426a-89c6-451cf89bcffc", "615c5d3b-e1e6-4c4e-92f9-d117f134ef4d", "6c649a1e-9218-46a6-a2c2-28b58bbef790", "6d2de9be-4055-4fcf-927d-a67d4ef3aa93", "6dc29c47-0c8e-477e-b734-2f4d4b7c16f1", "6ec957f0-a142-47d0-b4d0-0e30d353faf1", "740771e3-184d-4bb3-b0d1-8122abf0d6a2", "815b8d5a-064c-487f-add1-3594abf61cf1", "88d69a2b-48c8-4118-b342-1e1ed647fec3", "90569e63-fc75-4d26-8f53-2459bda2a3c2", "913a73c4-9c77-4205-ae03-dde2f86b2a84", "9c87ac50-99d9-4946-93bc-51c5a404ab91", "a4b91c17-feac-445a-8b38-6b01bae926fb", "a50d937a-78f2-4c24-a8aa-a75035c00afb", "aafc7973-a122-46e7-80aa-607f4ab89200", "ae9e773b-e425-4fe3-b71e-8152023a095d", "aec4a087-c56b-48ad-9dd8-0c866c42c102", "b44ecd54-fef9-43b9-b56a-d9101d053471", "b4f8287c-af8e-4606-bde8-d9d953361a54", "b7872d2f-c3a2-49d2-a279-4a9976a28349", "beb04b88-5cd7-4233-b68e-064c88260678", "c7a48515-84bd-435c-bd54-6ed5e940eb2f", "c7e4e04b-45da-4bae-8c8a-d17ca0087361", "d60c18a8-3e2f-4130-afaf-9cfa767b104b", "da40d3db-d3e3-46d4-b632-7e510f118b13", "df395961-5fc1-46c9-bf62-4a3d1fe7e456", "e24c954d-bf5d-4efd-acc6-cc156f5d8597", "e631c260-3c2d-4afb-85ce-13850d78b6c5", "e7276c83-8abe-4af6-aa3e-07d462c05aea", "ef78330f-d706-48b4-a37d-4a971ab0c1d5", "f7113dbd-de63-49b0-b918-6f1bb61245dc", "f7e05a5f-8b44-4c67-967b-6c7cb416d2d8", "fa619312-6a30-40c5-bd8e-f09dffce0543", "fabf6595-1331-4f1a-a6e0-24e1001a1fe7", "fe93988a-7e1e-4b58-90b9-174839a37d54", "feaac7d9-cebc-4ac8-bba1-976ab606fe81"], "title": "Emerging Graph Queries in Linked Data", "venue": "international conference on data engineering", "year": 2012, "id": "5bdccc2d-9a03-4082-b53b-4ed8d55da918"}
{"abstract": "Keyword search enables inexperienced users to easily search XML database with no specific knowledge of complex structured query languages and XML data schemas. Existing work has addressed the problem of selecting data nodes that match keywords and connecting them in a meaningful way, e.g., SLCA and ELCA. However, it is time-consuming and unnecessary to serve all the connected subtrees to the users because in general the users are only interested in part of the relevant results. In this paper, we propose a new keyword search approach which basically utilizes the statistics of underlying XML data to decide the promising result types and then quickly retrieves the corresponding results with the help of selected promising result types. To guarantee the quality of the selected promising result types, we measure the correlations between result types and a keyword query by analyzing the distribution of relevant keywords and their structures within the XML data to be searched. In addition, relevant result types can be efficiently computed without keyword query evaluation and any schema information. To directly return top-k keyword search results that conform to the suggested promising result types, we design two new algorithms to adapt to the structural sensitivity of the keyword nodes over the keyword search results. Lastly, we implement all proposed approaches and present the relevant experimental results to show the effectiveness of our approach.", "authors": ["Jianxin Li", "Chengfei Liu", "Rui Zhou", "Wei Wang"], "references": ["0b6f4339-03a1-48b3-8ade-d3468115c881", "0bd367f0-7925-406e-afed-9379d85e9eb9", "140ea03f-137f-44d0-b65a-a713d31435c4", "1651a72b-7cfe-4cce-995d-e00ab55bd815", "2223fe6a-cddc-4faf-8a88-4940cb570790", "282dd5f8-35ba-44e4-ad16-00f30e3a60e8", "2b53ea64-1116-4ec2-8a6f-b3bc620c16e9", "30bad70c-c78c-4729-b925-b7b6c2cea085", "348acd30-4c4e-4f56-9dd3-f4b5f2841394", "3a7aa31e-c5cb-41af-b607-d1b27a3141f9", "41844318-5847-4d77-a39c-41e33c0ba094", "55cf597f-c4ea-4382-9190-10f349aa1f2c", "66c9bc98-7530-43e5-845e-003fca09785c", "6c476d40-3507-4f02-9090-be0cc83b7d49", "80dfe03d-9e11-4207-9a08-8d6961fd48f3", "8c2930b4-eab0-43c0-8448-a626fbda5c7f", "9e326de5-fde2-463b-9fec-3d13cc96fad0", "a4b91c17-feac-445a-8b38-6b01bae926fb", "a5d5fa74-968c-4e45-8a97-26c3f2f3de3d", "c5d3e3f0-7438-485c-9728-a67f5c65ddd8", "d545537e-75e9-408b-9c5f-b106492ba681", "d9ac28c0-daee-4539-b769-1ec1ec7e3f46", "da052785-1079-471b-9e70-137e5ddc9ca9", "f15e8e8d-954d-4d98-b57f-200a0863a000", "f242894c-0ab0-49c9-bde8-10f193bdd3b8"], "title": "XML keyword search with promising result type recommendations", "venue": "World Wide Web", "year": 2014, "id": "5d6bb33e-7c8e-456c-9a10-937f4d2bebf7"}
{"abstract": "How can we detect suspicious users in large online networks? Online popularity of a user or product (via follows, page-likes, etc.) can be monetized on the premise of higher ad click-through rates or increased sales. Web services and social networks which incentivize popularity thus suffer from a major problem of fake connections from link fraudsters looking to make a quick buck. Typical methods of catching this suspicious behavior use spectral techniques to spot large groups of often blatantly fraudulent (but sometimes honest) users. However, small-scale, stealthy attacks may go unnoticed due to the nature of low-rank Eigen analysis used in practice. In this work, we take an adversarial approach to find and prove claims about the weaknesses of modern, state-of-the-art spectral methods and propose fBox, an algorithm designed to catch small-scale, stealth attacks that slip below the radar. Our algorithm has the following desirable properties: (a) it has theoretical underpinnings, (b) it is shown to be highly effective on real data and (c) it is scalable (linear on the input size). We evaluate fBox on a large, public 41.7 million node, 1.5 billion edge who-follows-whom social graph from Twitter in 2010 and with high precision identify many suspicious accounts which have persisted without suspension even to this day.", "authors": ["Neil Shah", "Alex Beutel", "Brian Gallagher", "Christos Faloutsos"], "references": ["01dc1bf5-9202-44b3-8071-db6f07e3260c", "1089af07-1a31-4521-b4cf-ddfe51db054c", "12b5f05e-19e3-42ba-82e5-030ad311e3ae", "1994f74c-bf49-40b3-afc9-53914bde82ac", "35bbc25b-c5c7-46ce-8248-0c3bcd2fef36", "4a2a1557-c28c-4796-9cbd-2e525c22cc55", "518693c1-d802-4f9a-b7d4-cfae767ed763", "72809fb8-19ad-4097-9c9c-799e9fbc0198", "7ed2f898-0d0e-41b1-82d9-8b41f45db777", "923b75e2-a1e6-4be6-9677-72dee20308ad", "9c9dc434-eaab-4443-82d0-977a122179b9", "a253ebcb-96af-4a2f-8946-6582a9dd13e9", "a9994cb0-eef9-4a44-bb65-ea4c9aaf23ed", "af534280-5ab9-4d01-a21d-01e49705e4ec", "beaaecba-14eb-4284-8d06-075de9364c13", "e9f868ad-7254-4925-b6fc-385bee5dea45", "ea5ed7ea-87ca-4c45-8794-8d7746b4e018", "ea8cd3d8-17ae-4a1e-8f83-1609469087af", "f03017bf-4965-4f36-bb0c-7c7cc32dd9a1"], "title": "Spotting Suspicious Link Behavior with fBox: An Adversarial Perspective", "venue": "international conference on data mining", "year": 2014, "id": "5dbf3a5f-37c9-47eb-9ce9-2aefc44d894e"}
{"abstract": "Twitter has become one of the largest platforms for users around the world to share anything happening around them with friends and beyond. A bursty topic in Twitter is one that triggers a surge of relevant tweets within a short time, which often reflects important events of mass interest. How to leverage Twitter for early detection of bursty topics has therefore become an important research problem with immense practical value. Despite the wealth of research work on topic modeling and analysis in Twitter, it remains a huge challenge to detect bursty topics in real-time. As existing methods can hardly scale to handle the task with the tweet stream in real-time, we propose in this paper Topic Sketch, a novel sketch-based topic model together with a set of techniques to achieve real-time detection. We evaluate our solution on a tweet stream with over 30 million tweets. Our experiment results show both efficiency and effectiveness of our approach. Especially it is also demonstrated that Topic Sketch can potentially handle hundreds of millions tweets per day which is close to the total number of daily tweets in Twitter and present bursty event in finer-granularity.", "authors": ["Wei Xie", "Feida Zhu", "Jing Jiang", "Ee Peng Lim", "Ke Wang"], "references": ["0d2b914c-84b0-4f22-8d1a-9dd974280505", "1a3a9715-607a-4b0e-8561-1253640436a6", "28903e7b-aa3b-4840-b634-916029ed6c77", "323cf346-5269-4834-99b6-783f7e639d4d", "52cd1215-1690-4668-b13d-894aa2ed47cd", "548f8efe-f694-4ca0-98aa-42346d8ad0ff", "55cc563b-82a4-4a24-84c4-11ab3b93cc0b", "58767d4c-92fc-4f36-b52e-231460ecb71d", "60798bc3-51e5-41b8-8276-4afaa47fd0d3", "67d1bb30-428a-4c42-b280-311b6c98d2cd", "6a769ef6-b720-4bb2-bdf8-9a74d5f35fb0", "79b938b2-023d-44ae-9a9d-9ee73a3ac028", "8c0bfce0-42ee-49c9-8432-c608f2708ec2", "8dea51fc-4156-4de8-a1df-ff52335f30fd", "956c6250-c1d5-4f70-bbc7-8e8901b7885a", "95a54be2-eb55-459f-9d6c-b70f357a2ed8", "c4b3f249-66b6-49ac-a01d-37161922694e", "ce60ea5e-1cdb-415a-9c56-231db02111c4", "d38a74f0-1628-4d0e-92cf-72e3f6f6b6f7", "dd3d46c4-89c6-41e6-99ae-c8ffb2a5adb2", "e23e3b0a-5984-4b3f-8755-0c565d48a1ee", "e9a13666-2463-4c37-9299-b3c4e80ad124", "f18e01b9-4e98-453a-8c9b-2d3032ff1237", "f2fa9ea1-c221-40c2-adc9-0cca81bb5602", "fcce3147-a07f-4066-8fb8-9e85a129af59"], "title": "TopicSketch: Real-Time Bursty Topic Detection from Twitter", "venue": "international conference on data mining", "year": 2013, "id": "5de9c3ba-5202-4d17-a176-5700c9bb1605"}
{"abstract": "In the era of big data, a large amount of noisy and incomplete data can be collected from multiple sources for prediction tasks. Combining multiple models or data sources helps to counteract the effects of low data quality and the bias of any single model or data source, and thus can improve the robustness and the performance of predictive models. Out of privacy, storage and bandwidth considerations, in certain circumstances one has to combine the predictions from multiple models or data sources without accessing the raw data. Consensus-based prediction combination algorithms are effective for such situations. However, current research on prediction combination focuses on the single label setting, where an instance can have one and only one label. Nonetheless, data nowadays are usually multilabeled, such that more than one label have to be predicted at the same time. Direct applications of existing prediction combination methods to multilabel settings can lead to degenerated performance. In this paper, we address the challenges of combining predictions from multiple multilabel classifiers and propose two novel algorithms, MLCM-r (MultiLabel Consensus Maximization for ranking) and MLCM-a (MLCM for microAUC). These algorithms can capture label correlations that are common in multilabel classifications, and optimize corresponding performance metrics.

{"abstract": "Relevance feedback is a powerful technique to enhance Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) performance. It solicits the user's relevance judgments on the retrieved images returned by the CBIR systems. The user's labeling is then used to learn a classifier to distinguish between relevant and irrelevant images. However, the top returnedimages may not be the most informative ones. The challenge is thus to determine which unlabeled images would be the most informative (i.e., improve the classifier the most) if they were labeled and used as training samples. In this paper, we propose a novel active learning algorithm, called  Laplacian Optimal Design  (LOD), for relevance feedback image retrieval. Our algorithm is based on aregression model which minimizes the least square error on the measured (or, labeled) images and simultaneously preserves the local geometrical structure of the image space. Specifically, we assume that if two images are sufficiently close to each other, then their measurements (or, labels) are close as well. By constructing a nearest neighbor graph, the geometrical structure of the image space can be described by the graph Laplacian. We discuss how results from the field of optimal experimental design may be used to guide our selection of a subset of images, which gives us the most amount of information. Experimental results on Corel database suggest that theproposed approach achieves higher precision in relevance feedback image retrieval.", "authors": ["Xiaofei He", "Wanli Min", "Deng Cai", "Kun Zhou"], "references": ["13b91eb0-0857-4556-b32a-0f85a1cf43f6", "19f7eb36-d881-4873-a3be-f045c0cb7880", "1d0a0a4e-2992-4f52-9086-93b0b717fb56", "3aab3820-7a75-4935-84c5-fd314761b05f", "3e11612e-d08c-438a-a4b9-c82ef788efe6", "40c205ac-5e74-4f68-8f43-47657786f61a", "427ce2d6-f723-421b-a0b0-0e1b02d30945", "54cfd901-30e6-4bd0-9360-756b7d9f68dd", "750b0ac1-2ac9-4273-a9c8-baad11e26fcd", "7a7ae04e-d013-4e0c-afba-10231a9b6e0e", "8735c7ea-f5c6-4310-b250-bc0d1bf5e834", "8dcdf79e-e581-411e-9049-6d043b434efa", "a2ed7fe7-dd1d-4910-9d5e-57f48f64598d", "c0c949bc-4954-49ba-a5e1-96d30128e7b1", "c698b0f4-e5d4-46da-80f1-d6d75fea9ded", "c6c77308-db90-4f99-9c68-2759fcc8c3bc", "cb9c5d5b-592b-4f47-90a6-f14a8793a8ba", "cf55ed78-6e51-4f32-a7b5-52305a92eb9f", "dfcfd27b-ff19-4f31-a10d-59a26d04957a", "f815f346-6707-4036-b766-0a0ca290809f"], "title": "Laplacian optimal design for image retrieval", "venue": "international acm sigir conference on research and development in information retrieval", "year": 2007, "id": "5f2c6442-606f-421a-8c28-4c99ab785212"}
{"abstract": "K Nearest Neighbor search has many applications including data mining, multi-media, image processing, and monitoring moving objects. In this paper, we study the problem of KNN over multi-valued objects. We aim to provide effective and efficient techniques to identify KNN sensitive to relative distributions of objects.We propose to use quantiles to summarize relative-distribution-sensitive K nearest neighbors. Given a query Q and a quantile \u03c6 \u2208 (0, 1], we firstly study the problem of efficiently computing K nearest objects based on a \u03c6-quantile distance (e.g. median distance) from each object to Q. The second problem is to retrieve the K nearest objects to Q based on overall distances in the \u201cbest population\u201d (with a given size specified by \u03c6-quantile) for each object.

{"abstract": "Many applications process data in which there exists a ``conservation law'' between related quantities. For example, in traffic monitoring, every incoming event, such as a packet's entering a router or a car's entering an intersection, should ideally have an immediate outgoing counterpart.

We give confidence metrics that quantify how strongly a conservation rule holds and present approximation algorithms (with error guarantees) for the problem of discovering a concise summary of subsets of the data that satisfy a given conservation rule.

{"abstract": "Community detection algorithms are fundamental tools that allow us to uncover organizational principles in networks. When detecting communities, there are two possible sources of information one can use: the network structure, and the features and attributes of nodes. Even though communities form around nodes that have common edges and common attributes, typically, algorithms have only focused on one of these two data modalities: community detection algorithms traditionally focus only on the network structure, while clustering algorithms mostly consider only node attributes. In this paper, we develop Communities from Edge Structure and Node Attributes (CESNA), an accurate and scalable algorithm for detecting overlapping communities in networks with node attributes. CESNA statistically models the interaction between the network structure and the node attributes, which leads to more accurate community detection as well as improved robustness in the presence of noise in the network structure. CESNA has a linear runtime in the network size and is able to process networks an order of magnitude larger than comparable approaches. Last, CESNA also helps with the interpretation of detected communities by finding relevant node attributes for each community.", "authors": ["Jaewon Yang", "Julian McAuley", "Jure Leskovec"], "references": ["0ad2acb7-43ee-424d-b4d2-472e167a9c84", "0d38b60f-2002-46e9-b726-ccb995eed3fb", "1b958586-323f-4e5b-b9b9-d2cfe9b272c2", "1bc10bbb-215a-4fab-a835-2fe7d1821c85", "23609d17-17da-46b0-9541-07e13b40e5ea", "266fe2bc-554f-4292-a300-76d23df5376e", "347b8b7b-8e55-4bd5-9351-7f5e342824e7", "35cad820-9f36-41ac-86e7-b14bf90e75ba", "486a67bb-7313-4ba6-ac44-451e4a519952", "4f362ece-bab3-48dc-b210-dc0336500684", "59da8d4a-f21b-4917-a485-edb75519e1cf", "5cd09730-501b-498f-8fc2-face7099c9cc", "5d4e1b4f-5eab-4077-aacd-d362f0fbcd9e", "622ebe30-cc8d-4621-86e6-408919fc2157", "68faab18-b537-4f62-85cf-ddc9ef352362", "6f22a32a-8143-4846-b989-8d7de3fe829f", "761ad175-20d9-462e-adc8-020561a36fd3", "7abd5ce4-3aff-4598-b897-9009959fc8db", "8d69f306-5363-414e-ad91-a4c3812440a4", "8e5a5082-4516-4d61-9511-7b5a08011441", "93345870-deb6-4220-ad56-0119ea72a7e6", "9b877784-d99c-42fd-a6dd-0918cda5a13e", "ae61a4d0-3e5a-4e82-af78-33e093b48395", "ae64c613-307e-4538-bc28-1fe8f1367a41", "b336dab8-0c89-4100-896b-c01ada791b11", "b51d0d34-1370-4a0b-ac64-d6113cf86115", "b5576bd2-8bb7-437c-8972-3b2bc9262606", "c7ce3856-2061-435b-ac3c-38c27f5b4782", "c84377af-cffc-438c-bda8-1d96f43b86a1", "d20ed8ad-eb6a-4642-9eeb-5bf1c28c74b8", "e95957bf-063a-4a55-8496-c3890204f1e2"], "title": "Community Detection in Networks with Node Attributes", "venue": "international conference on data mining", "year": 2013, "id": "5fcbf803-e461-4e8d-ae9c-1bbc7ad5afcb"}

The crawlers work independently, therefore the failing of one crawler does not affect the others at all. The framework ensures that no redundant crawling would occur.

{"abstract": "Email correspondents play an important role in many people's social networks. Finding email correspondents in social networks accurately, though may seem to be straightforward at a first glance, is challenging. Most of the existing online social networking sites recommend possible matches by comparing the information of email accounts and social network profiles, such as display names and email addresses. However, as shown empirically in this paper, such methods may not be effective in practice. To the best of our knowledge, this problem has not been carefully and thoroughly addressed in research. In this paper, we systematically investigate the problem and develop a practical data mining approach. We find that using only the profiles or the graph structures is far from effective. Our method utilizes the similarity between email accounts and social network user profiles, and at the same time explores the similarity between the email communication network and the social network under investigation.

{"abstract": "Recommendation systems have been widely used in E-commerce sites, social networks, etc. One of the core tasks in recommendation systems is to predict the users' ratings on items. Although many models and algorithms have been proposed, how to make accurate prediction for new users with extremely few rating records still remains a big challenge, which is called the cold start problem. Many existing methods utilize additional information, such as social graphs, to cope with the cold start problem. However, the side information may not always be available. In contrast to such methods, we propose a more general solution to address the cold start problem based on the observed user rating records only. Specifically we define a random walk on a bipartite graph of users and items to simulate the preference propagation among users, in order to alleviate the data sparsity problem for cold start users. Then we propose a Monte Carlo algorithm to estimate the similarity between different users. This algorithm takes a precomputation approach, and thus can efficiently compute the user similarity given any new user for rating prediction. In addition, our algorithm can easily handle dynamic updates and can be parallelized naturally, which are crucial for large recommendation systems.

{"abstract": "The importance of introducing distance constraints to data dependencies, such as differential dependencies (DDs) [28], has recently been recognized. The metric distance constraints are tolerant to small variations, which enable them apply to wide data quality checking applications, such as detecting data violations. However, the determination of distance thresholds for the metric distance constraints is non-trivial. It often relies on a truth data instance which embeds the distance constraints. To find useful distance threshold patterns from data, there are several guidelines of statistical measures to specify, e.g., support, confidence and dependent quality. Unfortunately, given a data instance, users might not have any knowledge about the data distribution, thus it is very challenging to set the right parameters. In this paper, we study the determination of distance thresholds for metric distance constraints, in a parameter-free style. Specifically, we compute an expected utility based on the statistical measures from the data. According to our analysis as well as experimental verification, distance threshold patterns with higher expected utility could offer better usage in real applications, such as violation detection. We then develop efficient algorithms to determine the distance thresholds having the maximum expected utility.

{"abstract": "Link prediction is an important task in network analysis, benefiting researchers and organizations in a variety of fields. Many networks in the real world, for example social networks, are heterogeneous, having multiple types of links and complex dependency structures. Link prediction in such networks must model the influence propagating between heterogeneous relationships to achieve better link prediction performance than in homogeneous networks. In this paper, we introduce Multi-Relational Influence Propagation (MRIP), a novel probabilistic method for heterogeneous networks. We demonstrate that MRIP is useful for predicting links in sparse networks, which present a significant challenge due to the severe disproportion of the number of potential links to the number of real formed links. We also explore some factors that can inform the task of classification yet remain unexplored, such as temporal information.

{"abstract": "We present Content Extraction via Tag Ratios (CETR) - a method to extract content text from diverse webpages by using the HTML document's tag ratios. We describe how to compute tag ratios on a line-by-line basis and then cluster the resulting histogram into content and non-content areas. Initially, we find that the tag ratio histogram is not easily clustered because of its one-dimensionality; therefore we extend the original approach in order to model the data in two dimensions. Next, we present a tailored clustering technique which operates on the two-dimensional model, and then evaluate our approach against a large set of alternative methods using standard accuracy, precision and recall metrics on a large and varied Web corpus. Finally, we show that, in most cases, CETR achieves better content extraction performance than existing methods, especially across varying web domains, languages and styles.", "authors": ["Tim Weninger", "William H.

{"abstract": "We investigate how to estimate information trustworthiness by considering multiple information sources jointly in a latent matrix space. We particularly focus on user review and recommendation systems, as there are multiple platforms where people can rate items and services that they have purchased, and many potential customers rely on these opinions to make decisions. Information trustworthiness is a serious problem because ratings are generated freely by end-users so that many stammers take advantage of freedom of speech to promote their business or damage reputation of competitors. We propose to simply use customer ratings to estimate each individual source's reliability by exploring correlations among multiple sources. Ratings of items are provided by users of diverse tastes and styles, and thus may appear noisy and conflicting across sources, however, they share some underlying common behavior. Therefore, we can group users based on their opinions, and a source is reliable on an item if its opinions given by latent groups are consistent across platforms. Inspired by this observation, we solve the problem by a two-step model -- a joint matrix factorization procedure followed by reliability score computation. We propose two effective approaches to decompose rating matrices as the products of group membership and group rating matrices, and then compute consistency degrees from group rating matrices as source reliability scores. We conduct experiments on both synthetic data and real user ratings collected from Orbitz, Priceline and Trip Advisor on all the hotels in Las Vegas and New York City. Results show that the proposed method is able to give accurate estimates of source reliability and thus successfully identify inconsistent, conflicting and unreliable information.", "authors": ["Liang Ge", "Jing Gao", "Xiao Yu", "Wei Fan", "Aidong Zhang"], "references": ["0f817997-a6e5-4d6f-b7fe-e3c95945f688", "164d2134-c316-4c6b-88e7-047af3171e57", "1976db1f-ba16-433b-b918-c04a50293153", "408f95bf-bae8-4146-ba25-feb2f59a78a7", "4c1564bc-af6d-4c72-8889-51ca1cc73d35", "53c99422-2b79-4199-a6ec-f2bf68bc6c6d", "7d2bf089-7d7a-4f35-9afc-7e81fd6526c7", "839e59b8-b356-4329-ba79-97f981cf6768", "9b26f592-ea31-4600-9089-88c973ca1748", "a411fc0d-6ce4-4fe6-a9be-3ef6c355556a", "a52c6512-1227-4c2c-9083-4485562de692", "af534280-5ab9-4d01-a21d-01e49705e4ec", "b5bebaf2-694b-4a44-aa84-169c2a00685d", "c6cccac5-1fbe-406b-8bad-5f48e380e418", "d38e51f2-d4fd-455e-86ed-82e0fc28fc8d", "d4988bec-a755-4e81-bf7d-7f688138bd83", "d4cec1dc-9acb-4916-a854-9d4eab8a1085", "e8f276d4-6f13-468f-902f-ee1e270fa75e", "f6efb712-a3c4-491e-bb55-35b5434f59e1"], "title": "Estimating Local Information Trustworthiness via Multi-source Joint Matrix Factorization", "venue": "international conference on data mining", "year": 2012, "id": "6e398692-77ad-4680-9ffe-3611c7fa98a2"}
{"abstract": "The abundance of Web 2.0 resources in various media formats calls for better resource integration to enrich user experience. This naturally leads to a new cross-modal resource search requirement, in which a query is a resource in one modal and the results are closely related resources in other modalities. With cross-modal search, we can better exploit existing resources. Tags associated with Web 2.0 resources are intuitive medium to link resources with different modality together. However, tagging is by nature an ad hoc activity. They often contain noises and are affected by the subjective inclination of the tagger. Consequently, linking resources simply by tags will not be reliable. In this paper, we propose an approach for linking tagged resources to concepts extracted from Wikipedia, which has become a fairly reliable reference over the last few years. Compared to the tags, the concepts are therefore of higher quality. We develop effective methods for cross-modal search based on the concepts associated with resources.

{"abstract": "Given a topic and its top-k most relevant words generated by a topic model, how can we tell whether it is a low-quality or a high-quality topic? Topic models provide a low-dimensional representation of large document corpora, and drive many important applications such as summarization, document segmentation, word-sense disambiguation, etc. Evaluation of topic models is an important issue, since low-quality topics potentially degrade the performance of these applications. In this paper, we develop a graph mining and machine learning approach for the external evaluation of topic models. Based on the graph-centric features we extract from the projection of topic words on the Wikipedia page-links graph, we learn models that can predict the human-perceived quality of topics (based on human judgments), and classify them as high or low quality. Experiments on four real-world corpora show that our approach boosts the prediction performance up to 30% over three baselines of various complexities, and demonstrate the generality of our method to diverse domains.

{"abstract": "We consider the problem of document indexing and representation. Recently, Locality Preserving Indexing (LPI) was proposed for learning a compact document subspace. Different from Latent Semantic Indexing which is optimal in the sense of global Euclidean structure, LPI is optimal in the sense of local manifold structure. However, LPI is extremely sensitive to the number of dimensions. This makes it difficult to estimate the intrinsic dimensionality, while inaccurately estimated dimensionality would drastically degrade its performance. One reason leading to this problem is that LPI is non-orthogonal. Non-orthogonality distorts the metric structure of the document space. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm called Orthogonal LPI. Orthogonal LPI iteratively computes the mutually orthogonal basis functions which respect the local geometrical structure. Moreover, our empirical study shows that OLPI can have more locality preserving power than LPI. We compare the new algorithm to LSI and LPI. Extensive experimental results show that Orthogonal LPI obtains better performance than both LSI and LPI. More crucially, it is insensitive to the number of dimensions, which makes it an efficient data preprocessing method for text clustering, classification, retrieval, etc.", "authors": ["Deng Cai", "Xiaofei He"], "references": ["021a5e01-a0e8-4b1a-ad48-2fd23430efc3", "03d38a87-4560-4e21-bd0e-13d52d4df82e", "0c5380a4-f0c2-4dfd-a31a-8c57eaa8c5d2", "28903e7b-aa3b-4840-b634-916029ed6c77", "2f419e59-df2b-40fe-bc60-cb16bbfbe429", "304d8aa6-1da6-4325-805a-34494e095846", "31d1a3f9-73ab-4dd3-8977-6b322e5ecc1d", "60013651-9f84-4c1a-9ffe-c3af7a557c3c", "6bd8c0ef-5452-4a98-9f39-37efbe172b8b", "7ccf7b6e-47da-479c-a8dd-a69a8d4b0d0d", "ac14afe6-de4d-4056-b2ac-0f6e36f369a2", "c19c233b-6b1d-40a9-b553-a6efbe11932c", "cbff2ff2-6b8f-425d-a5ef-aff0de9be3e5", "cfdda485-8384-43fc-a6b5-deb53e2491a3", "cfee1505-c5f2-4093-a928-2069c287811f"], "title": "Orthogonal locality preserving indexing", "venue": "international acm sigir conference on research and development in information retrieval", "year": 2005, "id": "71f18014-a35d-4b1c-a52c-05ea2a5cd8fd"}

{"abstract": "The World-Wide Web consists not only of a huge number of unstructured texts, but also a vast amount of valuable structured data.  Web tables  [2] are a typical type of structured information that are pervasive on the web, and Web-scale methods that automatically extract web tables have been studied extensively [1]. Many powerful systems (e.g.OCTOPUS [4], Mesa [3]) use extracted web tables as a fundamental component.   In the database vernacular, a table is defined as a set of tuples which have the same attributes. Similarly, a  web table  is defined as a set of rows (corresponding to database tuples) which have the same column headers (corresponding to database attributes). Therefore, to extract a web table is to extract a relation on the web. In databases, tables often contain foreign keys which refer to other tables. Therefore, it follows that hyperlinks inside a web table sometimes function as foreign keys to other relations whose tuples are contained in the hyperlink's target pages. In this paper, we explore this idea by asking: can we discover new attributes for web tables by exploring hyperlinks inside web tables?

{"abstract": "In many networks including Internet Service Providers, transportation monitoring systems and the electric grid, measurements from a set of objects are continuously taken over time and used for important decisions such as provisioning and pricing. It is therefore vital to understand the completeness and reliability of such data. Given the large volume of data generated by these systems, rather than enumerating the times and objects incurring missing or spurious data, it is more effective to provide patterns (groups of tuples) concisely summarizing trends that may not otherwise be readily observable. In this paper, we define the Graph Tableau Discovery Problem where the measured tuples can be thought of as edges in a bipartite graph on an ordered attribute (time) and an unordered attribute (object identifiers). We define the problem of finding an optimal summary, show that it is NP-complete, and then provide a polynomial-time approximation algorithm with guarantees to find a good summary.

{"abstract": "We introduce a novel method of indexing graph databases in order to facilitate subgraph isomorphism and similarity queries. The index is comprised of two major data structures. The primary structure is a directed acyclic graph which contains a node for each of the unique, induced subgraphs of the database graphs. The secondary structure is a hash table which cross-indexes each subgraph for fast isomorphic lookup. In order to create a hash key independent of isomorphism, we utilize a code-based canonical representation of adjacency matrices, which we have further refined to improve computation speed. We validate the concept by demonstrating its effectiveness in answering queries for two practical datasets. Our experiments show that for subgraph isomorphism queries, our method outperforms existing methods by more than an order of magnitude.", "authors": ["David W.

{"abstract": "The advance of object tracking technologies leads to huge volumes of spatio-temporal data collected in the form of trajectory data stream. In this study, we investigate the problem of discovering object groups that travel together (i.e., traveling companions) from trajectory stream. Such technique has broad applications in the areas of scientific study, transportation management and military surveillance. To discover traveling companions, the monitoring system should cluster the objects of each snapshot and intersect the clustering results to retrieve moving-together objects. Since both clustering and intersection steps involve high computational overhead, the key issue of companion discovery is to improve the algorithm's efficiency. We propose the models of closed companion candidates and smart intersection to accelerate data processing. A new data structure termed traveling buddy is designed to facilitate scalable and flexible companion discovery on trajectory stream. The traveling buddies are micro-groups of objects that are tightly bound together. By only storing the object relationships rather than their spatial coordinates, the buddies can be dynamically maintained along trajectory stream with low cost. Based on traveling buddies, the system can discover companions without accessing the object details. The proposed methods are evaluated with extensive experiments on both real and synthetic datasets. The buddy-based method is an order of magnitude faster than existing methods. It also outperforms other competitors with higher precision and recall in companion discovery.", "authors": ["Lu An Tang", "Yu Zheng", "Jing Yuan", "Jiawei Han", "Alice Leung", "Chih-Chieh Hung", "Wen-Chih Peng"], "references": ["0b2f02f1-7889-44fc-b754-0d048b16a306", "0ec5e0fd-60b2-4811-a3de-be325f271738", "117efe2f-0d83-4018-bcd8-fbeb066cdd83", "11ac53a6-7930-47c4-a7ba-7d82fa742672", "12f6914d-8045-4aa5-88c1-1c90a1990dbf", "188f969c-d3a6-4266-b401-a129904989da", "22b81d67-a506-45bb-adbf-4e1943f91016", "27ec3dcd-2aa9-4a81-9199-a5b678f0dae9", "35b21479-9742-4608-b25f-4bdd6b9a2ba0", "3731310b-da56-46c6-ac4d-0d33490aea20", "3dbb49ee-bc22-4f0b-b05e-2d66c212a6f5", "3e4e428d-d79c-41a5-a512-bbb9560d191b", "40ef754e-b0d0-418a-bd60-386f299256bc", "54a1ac27-b51e-4b66-938f-68449160e721", "64d8ab8b-7432-47c2-ae4f-b75c3315f3f1", "84239f2f-0f78-4baf-8a31-3e49ac8605af", "87eacd6d-84ab-4c1c-82d6-6c8da29e8cab", "98032764-0e51-4fe5-bdac-5755c29158b9", "a2448844-b1fa-4655-b778-cc454d772b9d", "a6b41578-6a8b-4ac7-bb7c-c96a574428b0", "aae235d5-f67a-482d-a652-580be4017db2", "ba282b96-2270-473b-8855-22d313c5511d", "caf33dad-ac73-4f20-a8a8-9eeaa5147b7e", "e3a40536-5580-4c24-b273-4fa4dab2579e", "fb0fe732-1fad-4c66-b917-46318a0550fe", "fbf9c3bd-0480-45aa-ba71-4e979370e2a8"], "title": "On Discovery of Traveling Companions from Streaming Trajectories", "venue": "international conference on data engineering", "year": 2012, "id": "7d3cb95d-6edf-4a2c-9078-ab95d008426a"}
{"abstract": "With fast paced growth of digital data and exploding storage management costs, enterprises are looking for new ways to effectively manage their data. One such cost-effective paradigm is the storage-as-a-service model, in which enterprises outsource their storage to a storage service provider (SSP) by storing data at a remote SSP-managed site and accessing it over a high speed network. Often for a variety of reasons, enterprises find it unacceptable to fully trust the SSP and prefer to store data in an encrypted form. This typically limits collaboration and data sharing among enterprise users due to complex key management and access control challenges. In this paper, we propose a platform called SHAROES that provides data sharing capability over such outsourced storage environments. SHAROES provide rich *nix-like data sharing semantics over SSP stored data, without trusting the SSP for data confidentiality or access control. SHAROES is unique in its ability in reducing user involvement during setup and operation through the use of in-band key management and allows a near-seamless transition of existing storage environments to the new model. It is also superior in performance by minimizing the use of expensive public-key cryptography in metadata management. We present the architecture and implementation of various SHAROES components and our experiments demonstrate performance superior to other proposals by over 40% on a number of benchmarks.", "authors": ["Aameek Singh", "Ling Liu"], "references": ["05f73279-fa9c-48ef-a9c2-91ac38caaf23", "0d1775b0-f013-471f-aca4-39827963af7c", "25001c65-a09b-42d4-9f83-44114cb6d3fe", "314f5e22-dd3a-47d6-ae04-05691c341ba9", "3e9a8c60-0666-42a8-8aa4-f196518ba2dd", "553d6d86-654f-4f3e-b178-b9f3f6eb18b4", "71701721-5843-47e4-963b-13d52ec08c81", "aca549fb-49cb-4577-a2a4-664364444d08", "b064bf4f-30cc-4a66-8a04-4b72e8e616ae", "b804202b-60de-4ac5-8167-937df24e970e", "e2bc4d03-4318-4b8f-ac57-f73ed1732ee0", "ed804c0f-dad5-4ce5-9da3-f69da43f137a"], "title": "Sharoes: A Data Sharing Platform for Outsourced Enterprise Storage Environments", "venue": "international conference on data engineering", "year": 2008, "id": "7dbaf52d-97a7-4076-b699-e52a43c45902"}
{"abstract": "Personalized recommendation services have gained increasing popularity and attention in recent years as most useful information can be accessed online in real-time. Most online recommender systems try to address the information needs of users by virtue of both user and content information. Despite extensive recent advances, the problem of personalized recommendation remains challenging for at least two reasons. First, the user and item repositories undergo frequent changes, which makes traditional recommendation algorithms ineffective. Second, the so-called cold-start problem is difficult to address, as the information for learning a recommendation model is limited for new items or new users. Both challenges are formed by the dilemma of exploration and exploitation. In this paper, we formulate personalized recommendation as a contextual bandit problem to solve the exploration/exploitation dilemma. Specifically in our work, we propose a parameter-free bandit strategy, which employs a principled resampling approach called online bootstrap, to derive the distribution of estimated models in an online manner. Under the paradigm of probability matching, the proposed algorithm randomly samples a model from the derived distribution for every recommendation. Extensive empirical experiments on two real-world collections of web data (including online advertising and news recommendation) demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in terms of the click-through rate. The experimental results also show that this proposed algorithm is robust in the cold-start situation, in which there is no sufficient data or knowledge to tune the hyper-parameters.", "authors": ["Liang Tang", "Yexi Jiang", "Lei Li", "Chunqiu Zeng", "Tao Li"], "references": ["0d57175f-1c92-4697-aa6b-77fb9529081c", "11cbb2ce-e1e3-41bd-8846-67d8122a90c7", "21f49982-6754-49ea-b5ff-e2cab08bcee3", "2be2129a-5da4-4c47-8e7e-af2a1a9bc31c", "382a6316-2a4e-41a9-8232-29f80a841db2", "4812720f-49e0-443d-aa2e-0399c499f22c", "50f63a48-984b-4984-848c-bbc0d5b534a5", "5f6df04e-c149-4352-857c-fc152047a6d2", "66cca93f-03b1-4d78-8dc8-44102cd8937a", "747c892d-74b7-4d62-a76c-c2415a564f4a", "7dcb217c-acfe-4cfb-aafd-508415064b40", "81dd677c-c674-4d00-8c68-5c043fac18ed", "9094852c-9e6a-47cd-9083-2e5730bd6a75", "a369f6f1-0b75-43a2-9b3f-25f5d38e2a5f", "d1fcfcd1-faa8-4ba3-a0d2-50fb53a9f47f", "d2f70788-8eff-4db8-ad37-b1b8b7d73a07", "ddba17f2-28e5-4822-908a-bc83008156da", "e0e21fdd-a554-4d73-8c9a-900959ab2967", "f2fee27d-66bb-48f6-affa-c0826c8a8ea2", "f89fd9f3-f602-45e4-b482-1d55ed53e07a", "f93a5057-003d-474a-9061-ffbefc01c196", "fc1351af-b5c6-49c7-826b-9f64202821fa", "feddae21-3c05-4743-80fa-b8e101f1b93f"], "title": "Personalized Recommendation via Parameter-Free Contextual Bandits", "venue": "international acm sigir conference on research and development in information retrieval", "year": 2015, "id": "80205f59-585e-4d6f-9ba6-f5320f68d878"}

{"abstract": "Given publication titles and authors, what can we say about the evolution of scientific topics and communities over time? Which communities shrunk, which emerged, and which split, over time? And, when in time were the turning points? We propose TimeFall, which can automatically answer these questions given a social network/graph that evolves over time. The main novelty of the proposed approach is that it needs no user-defined parameters, relying instead on the principle of minimum description length (MDL), to extract the communities, and to find good cut-points in time when communities change abruptly: a cut-point is good, if it leads to shorter data description. We illustrate our algorithm on synthetic and large real datasets, and we show that the results of the TimeFall agree with human intuition.", "authors": ["Jure Ferlez", "Christos Faloutsos", "Jure Leskovec", "Dunja Mladenic", "Marko Grobelnik"], "references": ["15b9de4b-b1bf-468c-895a-4068f0c91b10", "9a3e62d9-2d53-41de-8db3-b896dce42ac3"], "title": "Monitoring Network Evolution using MDL", "venue": "international conference on data engineering", "year": 2008, "id": "872578f9-92db-4386-a534-7f17292869dd"}
{"abstract": "Information Geometry Metric Learning (IGML) is shown to be an effective algorithm for distance metric learning. In this paper, we attempt to alleviate two limitations of IGML: (A) the time complexity of IGML increases rapidly for high dimensional data, (B) IGML has to transform the input low rank kernel into a full-rank one since it is undefined for singular matrices. To this end, two novel algorithms, referred to as Efficient Information Geometry Metric Learning (EIGML) and Scalable Information Geometry Metric Learning (SIGML), are proposed. EIGML scales linearly with the dimensionality, resulting in significantly reduced computational complexity. As for SIGML, it is proven to have a range-space preserving property.

In contrast to most existing metric learning methods, both EIGML and SIGML have closed-form solutions and can be efficiently optimized.

{"abstract": "Recent studies have proposed methods to discover approximate frequent itemsets in the presence of random noise. By relaxing the rigid requirement of exact frequent pattern mining, some interesting patterns, which would previously be fragmented by exact pattern mining methods due to the random noise or measurement error, are successfully recovered. Unfortunately, a large number of \"uninteresting\" candidates are explored as well during the mining process, as a result of the relaxed pattern mining methodology. This severely slows down the mining process. Even worse, it is hard for an end user to distinguish the recovered interesting patterns from these uninteresting ones. In this paper, we propose an efficient algorithm AC-Close to recover the approximate closed itemsets from \"core patterns\". By focusing on the so-called core patterns, integrated with a top-down mining and several effective pruning strategies, the algorithm narrows down the search space to those potentially interesting ones. Experimental results show that AC-Close substantially outperforms the previously proposed method in terms of efficiency, while delivers a similar set of interesting recovered patterns.", "authors": ["Hong Cheng", "Philip S.

{"abstract": "A lot of data are in sequential formats. In this study, we are interested in sequential data that goes in pairs. There are many interesting datasets in this format coming from various domains including parallel textual corpora, duplicate bug reports, and other pairs of related sequences of events. Our goal is to mine a set of closed discriminative dyadic sequential patterns from a database of sequence pairs each belonging to one of the two classes +ve and -ve. These dyadic sequential patterns characterize the discriminating facets contrasting the two classes. They are potentially good features to be used for the classification of dyadic sequential data. They can be used to characterize and flag correct and incorrect translations from parallel textual corpora, automate the manual and time consuming duplicate bug report detection process, etc. We provide a solution of this new problem by proposing new search space traversal strategy, projected database structure, pruning properties, and novel mining algorithms. To demonstrate the scalability and utility of our solution, we have experimented with both synthetic and real datasets. Experiment results show that our solution is scalable.

{"abstract": "We introduce and formulate two types of random-walk domination problems in graphs motivated by a number of applications in practice (e.g., item-placement problem in online social networks, Ads-placement problem in advertisement networks, and resource-placement problem in P2P networks). Specifically, given a graph G, the goal of the first type of random-walk domination problem is to target k nodes such that the total hitting time of an L-length random walk starting from the remaining nodes to the targeted nodes is minimized. The second type of random-walk domination problem is to find k nodes to maximize the expected number of nodes that hit any one targeted node through an L-length random walk. We prove that these problems are two special instances of the submodular set function maximization with cardinality constraint problem. To solve them effectively, we propose a dynamic-programming (DP) based greedy algorithm which is with near-optimal performance guarantee. The DP-based greedy algorithm, however, is not very efficient due to the expensive marginal gain evaluation. To further speed up the algorithm, we propose an approximate greedy algorithm with linear time complexity w.r.t. the graph size and also with near-optimal performance guarantee. The approximate greedy algorithm is based on carefully designed random walk sampling and sample-materialization techniques.

{"abstract": "Clustering is one of the fundamental data mining tasks. While traditional clustering techniques assign each object to a single cluster only, in many applications it has been observed that objects might belong to multiple clusters with different degrees. In this work, we present a Bayesian framework to tackle the challenge of mixed membership clustering for vector data. We exploit the ideas of subspace clustering where the relevance of dimensions might be different for each cluster. Combining the relevance of the dimensions with the cluster membership degree of the objects, we propose a novel type of mixture model able to represent data containing mixed membership subspace clusters. For learning our model, we develop an efficient algorithm based on variational inference allowing easy parallelization.

To answer the above challenging problems, we analyze a massive who-call-whom networks as long as a year, gathered from records of two large mobile phone communication networks both with 2 million users and 2 billion of calls. We examine the calling behavior distribution at multiple time scales (e.g., day, week, month and quarter), and find that the distribution is not only skewed with a heavy tail, but also changing at different time scales. How to model the changing behavior, and whether there exists a distribution fitting the multi-scale data well? In this paper, first, we define a delta-stable distribution and a Multi-scale Distribution Fitting (MsDF) problem. Second, to analyze our observed distributions at different time scales, we propose a framework, Scale Power, which not only fits the multi-scale data distribution very well, but also works as a convolutional distribution mixture to explain the generation mechanism of the multi-scale distribution changing behavior. Third, Scale Power can conduct a fitting approximation from a small time scale data to a large time scale.

{"abstract": "In networks, contagions such as information, purchasing behaviors, and diseases, spread and diffuse from node to node over the edges of the network. Moreover, in real-world scenarios multiple contagions spread through the network simultaneously. These contagions not only propagate at the same time but they also interact and compete with each other as they spread over the network. While traditional empirical studies and models of diffusion consider individual contagions as independent and thus spreading in isolation, we study how different contagions interact with each other as they spread through the network. We develop a statistical model that allows for competition as well as cooperation of different contagions in information diffusion. Competing contagions decrease each other's probability of spreading, while cooperating contagions help each other in being adopted throughout the network. We evaluate our model on 18,000 contagions simultaneously spreading through the Twitter network. Our model learns how different contagions interact with each other and then uses these interactions to more accurately predict the diffusion of a contagion through the network. Moreover, the model also provides a compelling hypothesis for the principles that govern content interaction in information diffusion. Most importantly, we find very strong effects of interactions between contagions.

{"abstract": "Query auto-completion (QAC) facilitates user query composition by suggesting queries given query prefix inputs. In 2014, global users of Yahoo! Search saved more than 50% keystrokes when submitting English queries by selecting suggestions of QAC. Users' preference of queries can be inferred during user-QAC interactions, such as dwelling on suggestion lists for a long time without selecting query suggestions ranked at the top. However, the wealth of such implicit negative feedback has not been exploited for designing QAC models. Most existing QAC models rank suggested queries for given prefixes based on certain relevance scores.   We take the initiative towards studying implicit negative feed- back during user-QAC interactions. This motivates re-designing QAC in the more general \"(static) relevance\"(adaptive) implicit negative feedback? framework. We propose a novel adaptive model adaQAC that adapts query auto-completion to users' implicit negative feedback towards unselected query suggestions. We collect user-QAC interaction data and perform large-scale experiments. Empirical results show that implicit negative feedback significantly and consistently boosts the accuracy of the investigated static QAC models that only rely on relevance scores.

{"abstract": "Stream prediction based on episode rules of the form \"whenever a series of antecedent event types occurs, another series of consequent event types appears eventually\"has received intensive attention due to its broad applications such as reading sequence forecasting, stock trend analyzing, road traffic monitoring, and software fault preventing. Many previous works focus on the task of discovering a full set of episode rules or matching a single predefined episode rule, little emphasis has been attached to the systematic methodology of stream prediction. This paper fills the gap by constructing an efficient and effective episode predictor over an event stream which works on a three-step process of rule extracting, rule matching and result reporting. Aiming at this goal, we first propose an algorithm Extractor to extract all representative episode rules based on frequent closed episodes and their generators, then we introduce an approach Matcher to simultaneously match multiple episode rules by finding the latest minimal and non-overlapping occurrences of their antecedents, and finally we devise a strategy Reporter to report each prediction result containing a prediction interval and a series of event types.

{"abstract": "Monitoring global states of an application deployed over distributed nodes becomes prevalent in today's datacenters. State monitoring requires not only correct monitoring results but also minimum communication cost for efficiency and scalability. Most existing work adopts an instantaneous state monitoring approach, which triggers state alerts whenever a constraint is violated. Such an approach, however, may cause frequent and unnecessary state alerts due to unpredictable monitored value bursts and momentary outliers that are common in large-scale Internet applications. These false alerts may further lead to expensive and problematic counter-measures. To address this issue, we introduce window-based state monitoring in this paper. Window-based state monitoring evaluates whether state violation is continuous within a time window, and thus, gains immunity to short-term value bursts and outliers. Furthermore, we find that exploring the monitoring time window at distributed nodes achieves significant communication savings over instantaneous monitoring. Based on this finding, we develop WISE, a system that efficiently performs WIndow-based StatE monitoring at datacenter-scale. WISE is highlighted with three sets of techniques. First, WISE uses distributed filtering time windows and intelligently avoids global information collecting to achieve communication efficiency, while guaranteeing monitoring correctness at the same time. Second, WISE provides a suite of performance tuning techniques to minimize communication cost based on a sophisticated cost model. Third, WISE also employs a set of novel performance optimization techniques. Extensive experiments over both real world and synthetic traces show that WISE achieves a 50%\u201390% reduction in communication cost compared with existing instantaneous monitoring approaches and simple alternative schemes.", "authors": ["Shicong Meng", "Ting Wang", "Ling Liu"], "references": ["0b68727c-e9f8-4b71-87c0-ba34a7132c61", "0c8e9f17-4da0-4edb-9ea4-78dbc21ca0f4", "0dbfacfb-f2b2-4014-8de8-87d506ee3a41", "1639a4f2-8b20-40b9-878a-ab8bcec59044", "1d03213c-ad92-4629-b13c-c5481de28cd6", "21af9e21-22d1-407d-8b28-bdb38b7de894", "25c136d8-abec-43d9-bf8e-24ac17d4a875", "467df977-d458-40e6-99bb-dc40af8fc2ef", "525cac4f-62c2-43b5-904c-30cfa05bc9e9", "755d3080-b11b-40d6-8446-1e79bfa0618b", "7d677d03-8ad3-49c4-b8c1-e05745f016e0", "82a9f9c9-9e65-4398-8fb8-91f556710f09", "a24b1e7a-45b8-4027-b647-757099797d77", "af769209-748c-4b3e-8f10-a03c53cdd248", "c4583e2f-f637-4bc4-ad45-d6db90e37a75", "c5560c22-c1e4-4ab7-9263-0d12c0a5e58a", "c9fda204-c458-4303-9be7-a54a886e95bc", "cbb5a6f9-7fd1-4a52-b8d1-4963defdfa98", "cdfa424b-ba9f-4125-8dc0-688ba10f3345"], "title": "Monitoring continuous state violation in datacenters: Exploring the time dimension", "venue": "international conference on data engineering", "year": 2010, "id": "9c4e041a-766f-45d5-9562-c97b8b364c28"}
{"abstract": "Subspace clustering has attracted great attention due to its capability of finding salient patterns in high dimensional data. Order preserving subspace clusters have been proven to be important in high throughput gene expression analysis, since functionally related genes are often co-expressed under a set of experimental conditions. Such co-expression patterns can be represented by consistent orderings of attributes. Existing order preserving cluster models require all objects in a cluster have identical attribute order without deviation. However, real data are noisy due to measurement technology limitation and experimental variability which prohibits these strict models from revealing true clusters corrupted by noise. In this paper, we study the problem of revealing the order preserving clusters in the presence of noise. We propose a noise-tolerant model called approximate order preserving cluster (AOPC). Instead of requiring all objects in a cluster have identical attribute order, we require that (1) at least a certain fraction of the objects have identical attribute order; (2) other objects in the cluster may deviate from the consensus order by up to a certain fraction of attributes. We also propose an algorithm to mine AOPC.

{"abstract": "Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) has been widely used in many fields such as text classification, image recognition and bioinformatics, as it provides good generalization performance at a extremely fast learning speed. However, as the data volume in real-world applications becomes larger and larger, the traditional centralized ELM cannot learn such massive data efficiently. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel Distributed Extreme Learning Machine based on MapReduce framework, named ELM???, which can cover the shortage of traditional ELM whose learning ability is weak to huge dataset. Firstly, after adequately analyzing the property of traditional ELM, it can be found out that the most expensive computation part of the matrix Moore-Penrose generalized inverse operator in the output weight vector calculation is the matrix multiplication operator. Then, as the matrix multiplication operator is decomposable, a Distributed Extreme Learning Machine (ELM???) based on MapReduce framework can be developed, which can first calculate the matrix multiplication effectively with MapReduce in parallel, and then calculate the corresponding output weight vector with centralized computing. Therefore, the learning of massive data can be made effectively.

{"abstract": "Outlier detection has been a popular data mining task. However, there is a lack of serious study on outlier detection for trajectory data. Even worse, an existing trajectory outlier detection algorithm has limited capability to detect outlying sub- trajectories. In this paper, we propose a novel partition-and-detect framework for trajectory outlier detection, which partitions a trajectory into a set of line segments, and then, detects outlying line segments for trajectory outliers. The primary advantage of this framework is to detect outlying sub-trajectories from a trajectory database. Based on this partition-and-detect framework, we develop a trajectory outlier detection algorithm TRAOD. Our algorithm consists of two phases: partitioning and detection. For the first phase, we propose a two-level trajectory partitioning strategy that ensures both high quality and high efficiency. For the second phase, we present a hybrid of the distance-based and density-based approaches. Experimental results demonstrate that TRAOD correctly detects outlying sub-trajectories from real trajectory data.", "authors": ["Jae-Gil Lee", "Jiawei Han", "Xiaolei Li"], "references": ["32b5d46d-5e52-4ad9-aa5f-44f6a7ea873f", "7070053c-489f-402a-93ac-f87c152902cd", "8fea5421-a225-408d-aefa-3e025eef0506", "a22d71b6-61c4-4ae4-9843-931feb08e710", "a2da547b-630a-4a50-94fa-61c9054f56c9", "a883cd2f-54ff-4133-ad4d-f2f813db7744", "bd363c40-6a73-40ba-a748-76d0f621697f", "bd70917d-9291-4762-a69f-70230f68d9c4", "ca234976-dd6a-4203-b7d5-baf907a65976", "dd1ab1b2-b0f5-476f-a69d-9911724e63ad", "deec27c2-09ac-4932-bf12-f25b805d410f"], "title": "Trajectory Outlier Detection: A Partition-and-Detect Framework", "venue": "international conference on data engineering", "year": 2008, "id": "a0d04b77-afcb-4509-bcda-4647c76556ba"}

{"abstract": "In this paper, we propose to conduct anomaly detection across multiple sources to identify objects that have inconsistent behavior across these sources. We assume that a set of objects can be described from various perspectives (multiple information sources). The underlying clustering structure of normal objects is usually shared by multiple sources. However, anomalous objects belong to different clusters when considering different aspects. For example, there exist movies that are expected to be liked by kids by genre, but are liked by grown-ups based on user viewing history. To identify such objects, we propose to compute the distance between different eigen decomposition results of the same object with respect to different sources as its anomalous score. We also give interpretations from the perspectives of constrained spectral clustering and random walks over graph.

{"abstract": "Linked data consist of both node attributes, e.g., Preferences, posts and degrees, and links which describe the connections between nodes. They have been widely used to represent various network systems, such as social networks, biological networks and etc. Knowledge discovery on linked data is of great importance to many real applications. One of the major challenges of learning linked data is how to effectively and efficiently extract useful information from both node attributes and links in linked data. Current studies on this topic either use selected topological statistics to represent network structures, or linearly map node attributes and network structures to a shared latent feature space. However, while approaches based on statistics may miss critical patterns in network structure, approaches based on linear mappings may not be sufficient to capture the non-linear characteristics of nodes and links. To handle the challenge, we propose, to our knowledge, the first deep learning method to learn from linked data. A restricted Boltzmann machine model named LRBM is developed for representation learning on linked data. In LRBM, we aim to extract the latent feature representation of each node from both node attributes and network structures, non-linearly map each pair of nodes to the links, and use hidden units to control the mapping. The details of how to adapt LRBM for link prediction and node classification on linked data have also been presented. In the experiments, we test the performance of LRBM as well as other baselines on link prediction and node classification. Overall, the extensive experimental evaluations confirm the effectiveness of the proposed LRBM model in mining linked data.", "authors": ["Kang Li", "Jing Gao", "Suxin Guo", "Nan Du", "Xiaoyi Li", "Aidong Zhang"], "references": ["0ad2acb7-43ee-424d-b4d2-472e167a9c84", "11e67ba0-6db8-4e5b-9838-2c320c67069a", "1317f409-8cf6-4336-8e4e-ebfa92d28536", "156eb24c-3b8a-4060-a317-23ca25fd97fc", "4119077e-f77a-4056-8f3f-36fd86a668de", "4453fa3b-308f-472a-be61-65d1ce5c3de2", "46ddddd5-83b4-42aa-98b1-5c87a09f77d9", "49535f09-9dde-4681-8639-3685ca254b9a", "50e0fcf4-57d9-4ed6-ad7d-c9eb2bad8e42", "5217d97c-5256-4bb7-b501-faf36a474ca6", "67b8ba59-18de-44ae-9e22-5fbabf3f0c99", "69f988d0-f5e7-455f-a9fc-ee9d9a1c97ce", "6ec72c5e-6a7b-4024-8043-9a7d96b10d0c", "6f22c1e7-75b0-412e-b10d-663ea43d8a6f", "825d95f7-21af-478f-b76e-455431bad7a9", "849e4d39-3b8c-482c-be92-621b6b621296", "85847434-179b-4bbf-a19a-ee90b05ba42c", "89fcd0d9-50c2-4d60-978f-ad2d5e842fc6", "8d42f475-3498-4b72-9c53-dcb6af539ed0", "8ee02284-3b67-4a97-a945-0888fe6d941e", "a066e81b-eaec-41dc-bb9b-74dc6c011fe0", "b1bde621-17dc-4511-9878-9efa329a7ee4", "b5669efd-c60a-44d3-9d1d-6479ef1792c8", "c123b953-cd64-4967-b4a5-51de94f0ee95", "c4716aad-c8bc-431b-8173-0300064a77b0", "d0d13c7a-308c-4138-9802-8e7c0260bb90", "d20ed8ad-eb6a-4642-9eeb-5bf1c28c74b8", "d325523b-7564-44fe-9175-552c3d130cfc", "d4495396-85c1-4010-806a-7630db56eb8d", "da47b574-1fbc-422f-993e-4248cc416bb6", "ee2277a9-3009-40fb-83fc-9273058765ba"], "title": "LRBM: A Restricted Boltzmann Machine Based Approach for Representation Learning on Linked Data", "venue": "international conference on data mining", "year": 2014, "id": "a4ec4f2f-59ab-4ef2-9e12-5ed0d7358453"}

{"abstract": "One of the main organizing principles in real-world networks is that of network communities, where sets of nodes organize into densely linked clusters. Communities in networks often overlap as nodes can belong to multiple communities at once. Identifying such overlapping communities is crucial for the understanding the structure as well as the function of real-world networks. Even though community structure in networks has been widely studied in the past, practically all research makes an implicit assumption that overlaps between communities are less densely connected than the non-overlapping parts themselves. Here we validate this assumption on 6 large scale social, collaboration and information networks where nodes explicitly state their community memberships. By examining such ground-truth communities we find that the community overlaps are more densely connected than the non-overlapping parts, which is in sharp contrast to the conventional wisdom that community overlaps are more sparsely connected than the communities themselves. Practically all existing community detection methods fail to detect communities with dense overlaps. We propose Community-Affiliation Graph Model, a model-based community detection method that builds on bipartite node-community affiliation networks. Our method successfully captures overlapping, non-overlapping as well as hierarchically nested communities, and identifies relevant communities more accurately than the state-of-the-art methods in networks ranging from biological to social and information networks.", "authors": ["Jaewon Yang", "Jure Leskovec"], "references": ["23609d17-17da-46b0-9541-07e13b40e5ea", "266fe2bc-554f-4292-a300-76d23df5376e", "287df3fe-6f46-4071-8ab5-99274b9887b1", "3c0c7536-7f11-4e63-bf6d-32d67050d8ef", "40d9a6c9-b99e-43cc-90eb-5259cf4416a0", "48ba462b-0e41-44e3-a8dd-70286c85e022", "5cd09730-501b-498f-8fc2-face7099c9cc", "68faab18-b537-4f62-85cf-ddc9ef352362", "881ffdab-0f89-4a72-8655-8bc3a3fc6577", "8d009820-f7c2-4832-85ca-28ea4292459c", "9dbdc129-b8f3-4712-9c95-406bc8911bee", "aa35f1f9-396c-4909-b303-493b5cb44b89"], "title": "Community-Affiliation Graph Model for Overlapping Network Community Detection", "venue": "international conference on data mining", "year": 2012, "id": "a82095d0-0357-494c-9af5-71ce5bc6bd0e"}

{"abstract": "The Web has enabled one of the most visible recent developments in education---the deployment of massive open online courses. With their global reach and often staggering enrollments, MOOCs have the potential to become a major new mechanism for learning. Despite this early promise, however, MOOCs are still relatively unexplored and poorly understood.   In a MOOC, each student's complete interaction with the course materials takes place on the Web, thus providing a record of learner activity of unprecedented scale and resolution. In this work, we use such trace data to develop a conceptual framework for understanding how users currently engage with MOOCs. We develop a taxonomy of individual behavior, examine the different behavioral patterns of high- and low-achieving students, and investigate how forum participation relates to other parts of the course.   We also report on a large-scale deployment of badges as incentives for engagement in a MOOC, including randomized experiments in which the presentation of badges was varied across sub-populations.

{"abstract": "As social network services connect people across the world, influence maximization, i.e., finding the most influential nodes (or individuals) in the network, is being actively researched with applications to viral marketing. One crucial challenge in scalable influence maximization processing is evaluating influence, which is #P-hard and thus hard to solve in polynomial time. We propose a scalable influence approximation algorithm, Independent Path Algorithm (IPA) for Independent Cascade (IC) diffusion model. IPA efficiently approximates influence by considering an independent influence path as an influence evaluation unit. IPA are also easily parallelized by simply adding a few lines of OpenMP meta-programming expressions. Also, overhead of maintaining influence paths in memory is relieved by safely throwing away insignificant influence paths. Extensive experiments conducted on large-scale real social networks show that IPA is an order of magnitude faster and uses less memory than the state of the art algorithms. Our experimental results also show that parallel versions of IPA speeds up further as the number of CPU cores increases, and more speed-up is achieved for larger datasets.

{"abstract": "Errors in measurement can be categorized into two types: systematic errors that are predictable, and random errors that are inherently unpredictable and have null expected value. Random error is always present in a measurement. More often than not, readings in time series may contain inherent random errors due to causes like dynamic error, drift, noise, hysteresis, digitalization error and limited sampling frequency. Random errors may affect the quality of time series analysis substantially. Unfortunately, most of the existing time series mining and analysis methods, such as similarity search, clustering, and classification tasks, do not address random errors, possibly because random error in a time series, which can be modeled as a random variable of unknown distribution, is hard to handle. In this paper, we tackle this challenging problem. Taking similarity search as an example, which is an essential task in time series analysis, we develop MISQ, a statistical approach for random error reduction in time series analysis. The major intuition in our method is to use only the readings at different time instants in a time series to reduce random errors. We achieve a highly desirable property in MISQ: it can ensure that the recall is above a user-specified threshold. An extensive empirical study on 20 benchmark real data sets clearly shows that our method can lead to better performance than the baseline method without random error reduction in real applications such as classification. Moreover, MISQ achieves good quality in similarity search.", "authors": ["Wush Chi-Hsuan Wu", "Mi-Yen Yeh", "Jian Pei"], "references": ["237ecf87-ef87-4249-8871-e69b82ed5d7e", "2663d978-9596-4c7c-bf06-14f80ecf46a3", "28f13158-33aa-4d37-aea5-6b5ccb36fc09", "6c5e1d10-bd51-4ac6-83f8-b74efec751b2", "7a5b23b4-b171-4c19-8925-167583868f93", "8d99dd9a-2faf-4526-a071-4992a637dd32", "9b9bee43-e870-49b6-92e7-7591d56ca05f", "a20eec9a-c035-466f-b9f2-c7a7cce6810d", "a2b5e6c2-359a-4f41-ba7f-2c85e7783855", "ccfb8149-c5ce-4b67-9993-567c2924482b", "d4db8031-bfdd-470c-a160-b0715b3861e0", "ed0dadc4-7abe-4ff6-b097-126fa8cf110b"], "title": "Random Error Reduction in Similarity Search on Time Series: A Statistical Approach", "venue": "international conference on data engineering", "year": 2012, "id": "b1f04ec5-d091-483b-b408-45c1aa790ed5"}
{"abstract": "Almost all text applications use the well known  vector-space model  for text representation and analysis. While the vector-space model has proven itself to be an effective and efficient representation for mining purposes, it does not preserve information about the ordering of the words in the representation. In this paper, we will introduce the concept of  distance graph representations  of text data. Such representations preserve distance and ordering information between the words, and provide a much richer representation of the underlying text. This approach enables knowledge discovery from text which is not possible with the use of a pure vector-space representation, because it loses much less information about the ordering of the underlying words. Furthermore, this representation does not require the development of new mining and management techniques. This is because the technique can also be converted into a structural version of the vector-space representation, which allows the use of all existing tools for text. In addition, existing techniques for graph and XML data can be directly leveraged with this new representation. Thus, a much wider spectrum of algorithms is available for processing this representation.", "authors": ["Charu C.

{"abstract": "Document representation is a fundamental problem for text mining. Many efforts have been done to generate concise yet semantic representation, such as bag-of-words, phrase, sentence and topic-level descriptions. Nevertheless, most existing techniques counter difficulties in handling monolingual comparable corpus, which is a collection of monolingual documents conveying the same topic. In this paper, we propose the use of frame, a high-level semantic unit, and construct frame-based representations to semantically describe documents by bags of frames, using an information network approach. One major challenge in this representation is that semantically similar frames may be of different forms. For example, \"radiation leaked\" in one news article can appear as \"the level of radiation increased\" in another article. To tackle the problem, a text-based information network is constructed among frames and words, and a link-based similarity measure called SynRank is proposed to calculate similarity between frames. As a result, different variations of the semantically similar frames are merged into a single descriptive frame using clustering, and a document can then be represented as a bag of representative frames. It turns out that frame-based document representation not only is more interpretable, but also can facilitate other text analysis tasks such as event tracking effectively. We conduct both qualitative and quantitative experiments on three comparable news corpora, to study the effectiveness of frame-based document representation and the similarity measure SynRank, respectively, and demonstrate that the superior performance of frame-based document representation on different real-world applications.", "authors": ["Hyungsul Kim", "Xiang Ren", "Yizhou Sun", "Chi Wang", "Jiawei Han"], "references": ["2f419e59-df2b-40fe-bc60-cb16bbfbe429", "4adb467d-dacf-4019-b0d5-28ce1f323cf4", "55ab17e9-5c62-4157-adc9-28935eed7120", "68453f24-4276-4d0c-b37e-19d23af549be", "74eb5e4e-c241-4c7e-8969-699b105d4baa", "829f9b1f-d04f-49e8-aab7-2c278dff5427", "a66c42ad-8392-48dc-8347-24a208f99bda", "aafffa69-1bc3-4d18-8f3b-296c03a13557", "b1e7154e-c0f4-4f61-b209-fa1e058a1d51", "b97e0a93-9410-43c3-a0a7-8a37be4e9b8f", "bd9ddfec-ef37-45b6-918d-33a7a7794d58", "bdd8b9ba-232e-42ed-9fcb-4f57c6f4efba", "c2867eac-4a9d-4943-b250-9217800c2e2d", "d3194db7-6295-441e-9a6c-9fb2cb5a3fc5", "d34584d4-44fd-4172-a54b-ec903cbe1584", "d76f07e4-11ea-4ba6-aacf-e24478d62bca", "e3a40536-5580-4c24-b273-4fa4dab2579e", "ef144846-203c-45c0-9365-6a5533fb2be0", "f0114739-51ad-40d5-ac8c-07795717d3b9", "f3a20c90-cedd-48a9-b773-52170b398931", "f5ea23ea-aad0-44f0-a81c-a77cdc3784a7", "f6efb712-a3c4-491e-bb55-35b5434f59e1", "fa81a051-0f8e-4f10-a172-acd5a8923e23"], "title": "Semantic Frame-Based Document Representation for Comparable Corpora", "venue": "international conference on data mining", "year": 2013, "id": "b42dfe1f-0e44-4e4f-88d6-33ebee48ba3d"}

{"abstract": "In Service-Oriented Computing environments, there is a large number of service providers providing a variety of services to service customers. Conventional recommender systems, which adopt the information filtering techniques, can be used to automatically generate recommendations of service providers to service customers who are also the system users. However, data sparsity and trust enhancement are the traditional problems in recommender systems. Targeting the data sparsity problem, recent studies on recommender systems have started to leverage information from online social networks to collect recommendations from more participants and derive the final recommendation. However, this requires the methods to infer the trust between participants without any direct interactions in online social networks, which should take into account both the social context of participants and the context of the target services to be recommended, for trust enhanced recommendations. In this paper, we first present a contextual social network model that takes into account both participants' personal characteristics (referred to as the independent social context, including preference and expertise in domains) and mutual relations (referred to as the dependent social context, including the trust, social intimacy, and interaction context between two participants). In addition, we propose a new probabilistic approach, SocialTrust, as the first solution in the literature, to social context-aware trust inference in social networks. The result delivered by this approach is particularly important in evaluating the trust from a source participant to an end recommender who recommends a target service or service provider, via the sub-network consisting of intermediate participants/recommenders between them and relevant contextual information.

{"abstract": "Extracting useful correlation from a dataset has been extensively studied. In this paper, we deal with the opposite, namely, a problem we call correlation hiding (CH), which is fundamental in numerous applications that need to disseminate data containing sensitive information. In this problem, we are given a relational table T whose attributes can be classified into three disjoint sets A, B, and C. The objective is to distort some values in T so that A becomes independent from B, and yet, their correlation with C is preserved as much as possible. CH is different from all the problems studied previously in the area of data privacy, in that CH demands complete elimination of the correlation between two sets of attributes, whereas the previous research focuses on partial elimination up to a certain level. A new operator called independence masking is proposed to solve the CH problem. Implementations of the operator with good worst case guarantees are described in the full version of this short note.", "authors": ["Yufei Tao", "Jian Pei", "Jiexing Li", "Xiaokui Xiao", "Ke Yi", "Zhengzheng Xing"], "references": ["4e4837d8-3f23-4727-85a0-ebf14e0e39e2", "4e589195-cadb-4d90-8082-cf4307d6e24f", "5681eca7-a10e-4eeb-ab95-bcad4af4e228", "81c8fa5e-3b06-47e3-a12c-e02e5a298fa1", "fff9c11f-19a3-4422-ad82-007f3d0b0a2a"], "title": "Correlation hiding by independence masking", "venue": "international conference on data engineering", "year": 2010, "id": "b4d27d74-20a1-42f4-ae27-c148335ee7f5"}

{"abstract": "Collaborative filtering (CF) is one of the most successful recommendation approaches. It typically associates a user with a group of like-minded users based on their preferences over all the items, and recommends to the user those items enjoyed by others in the group. However we find that two users with similar tastes on one item subset may have totally different tastes on another set. In other words, there exist many user-item subgroups each consisting of a subset of items and a group of like-minded users on these items. It is more natural to make preference predictions for a user via the correlated subgroups than the entire user-item matrix. In this paper, to find meaningful subgroups, we formulate the Multiclass Co-Clustering (MCoC) problem and propose an effective solution to it. Then we propose an unified framework to extend the traditional CF algorithms by utilizing the subgroups information for improving their top-N recommendation performance. Our approach can be seen as an extension of traditional clustering CF models.

{"abstract": "Searching and mining large graphs today is critical to a variety of application domains, ranging from personalized recommendation in social networks, to searches for functional associations in biological pathways. In these domains, there is a need to perform aggregation operations on large-scale networks. Unfortunately the existing implementation of aggregation operations on relational databases does not guarantee superior performance in network space, especially when it involves edge traversals and joins of gigantic tables. In this paper, we investigate the neighborhood aggregation queries: Find nodes that have top-k highest aggregate values over their h-hop neighbors. While these basic queries are common in a wide range of search and recommendation tasks, surprisingly they have not been studied systematically. We developed a Local Neighborhood Aggregation framework, called LONA, to answer them efficiently. LONA exploits two properties unique in network space: First, the aggregate value for the neighboring nodes should be similar in most cases; Second, given the distribution of attribute values, it is possible to estimate the upper-bound value of aggregates. These two properties inspire the development of novel pruning techniques, forward pruning using differential index and backward pruning using partial distribution. Empirical results show that LONA could outperform the baseline algorithm up to 10 times in real-life large networks.", "authors": ["Xifeng Yan", "Bin He", "Feida Zhu", "Jiawei Han"], "references": ["0ad2acb7-43ee-424d-b4d2-472e167a9c84", "11f00b55-8460-47f5-addd-bdac422879c3", "2c066e28-3565-481b-822a-e13830532f82", "6415d03e-6198-44d4-9ca7-4308cab5ba7f", "68d41615-bea8-4d65-a190-74ecbf99f873", "9863baf6-d69f-495a-8d5a-71442adea84e", "a081c77c-a04b-4ff9-b391-9cd2a9fc5a40", "affc94dd-9fc9-4412-93ac-4196324ef24f", "c7e4e04b-45da-4bae-8c8a-d17ca0087361", "cf62ec65-678f-48df-bcf4-3df9bf8d246a", "ea95ef01-dcdb-4bac-a734-70fa67c7d05c", "edd3dc54-319d-42b1-9fe8-82712f39a4f0", "f6326c6d-6313-43fb-a028-5bfe5cf3505c", "f9fd5828-1327-4794-9002-fb2ee1531767"], "title": "Top-K aggregation queries over large networks", "venue": "international conference on data engineering", "year": 2010, "id": "b7872d2f-c3a2-49d2-a279-4a9976a28349"}
{"abstract": "An unsupervised clustering of the webpages on a website is a primary requirement for most wrapper induction and automated data extraction methods. Since page content can vary drastically across pages of one cluster (e.g., all product pages on amazon.com), traditional clustering methods typically use some distance function between the DOM trees representing a pair of webpages. However, without knowing which portions of the DOM tree are \"important,\" such distance functions might discriminate between similar pages based on trivial features (e.g., differing number of reviews on two product pages), or club together distinct types of pages based on superficial features present in the DOM trees of both (e.g., matching footer/copyright), leading to poor clustering performance.   We propose using search logs to automatically find paths in the DOM trees that mark out important portions of pages, e.g., the product title in a product page. Such paths are identified via a  global  analysis of the entire website, whereby search data for popular pages can be used to infer good paths even for other pages that receive little or no search traffic. The webpages on the website are then clustered using these \"key\" paths. Our algorithm only requires information on search queries, and the webpages clicked in response to them; there is no need for human input, and it does not need to be told which portion of a webpage the user found interesting. The resulting clusterings achieve an adjusted RAND score of over 0.9 on half of the websites (a score of 1 indicating a perfect clustering), and 59% better scores on average than competing algorithms. Besides leading to refined clusterings, these key paths can be useful in the wrapper induction process itself, as shown by the high degree of match between the key paths and the manually identified paths used in existing wrappers for these sites (90% average precision).", "authors": ["Deepayan Chakrabarti", "Rupesh R.

{"abstract": "Given a positive value r, a circular range query returns the objects that lie within the distance r of the query location. In this paper, we study the circular range queries that continuously change their locations. We present an efficient and effective technique to monitor such moving range queries by utilising the concept of a safe zone. The safe zone of a query is the area with a property that while the query remains inside it, the results of the query remain unchanged. Hence, the query does not need to be re-evaluated unless it leaves the safe zone. The shape of the safe zone is defined by the so-called guard objects. The cost of checking whether a query lies in the safe zone takes k distance computations, where k is the number of the guard objects. Our contributions are as follows. 1) We propose a technique based on powerful pruning rules and a unique access order which efficiently computes the safe zone and minimizes the I/O cost. 2) To show the effectiveness of the safe zone, we theoretically evaluate the probability that a query leaves the safe zone within one time unit and the expected distance a query moves before it leaves the safe zone. Additionally, for the queries that have diameter of the safe zone less than its expected value multiplied by a constant, we also give an upper bound on the expected number of guard objects. This upper bound turns out to be a constant, that is, it does not depend either on the radius r of the query or the density of the objects. The theoretical analysis is verified by extensive experiments. 3) Our thorough experimental study demonstrates that our proposed approach is close to optimal and is an order of magnitude faster than a naive algorithm.", "authors": ["Muhammad Aamir Cheema", "Ljiljana Brankovic", "Xuemin Lin", "Wenjie Zhang", "Wei Wang"], "references": ["01bbc454-f6b5-45f1-a64c-29be7a137712", "33a09ab5-515c-46fe-95bc-fa7d8cae46a8", "3d73de26-7429-41d5-b9ca-efd56e704ee7", "47c143b3-4694-48a5-8fe1-8be40f4bac12", "48b75a28-58c5-43ba-825e-11d630ff8cb0", "49cdc6d1-c34a-409a-9070-64d3efab9c12", "4a55893d-de8f-4b25-87d4-b1281d71c94f", "4f73d5cf-b997-4f55-be37-5c6f446aa7af", "50872497-b929-4a52-a0e8-62d03a561463", "5d1de1a8-a6e1-4d59-bb4b-81c47179afce", "76a724b5-03a5-4adf-ab50-9e20a00d0700", "89823908-c7f0-4b6f-8e62-3bd1ed91d31e", "8eb5686f-0172-4d9b-a2f2-3f9f840f1478", "91fdd0fa-e01a-45fc-95f1-65149954354c", "92b060d5-f076-42d3-b126-ba72f6e3b9f1", "a9db97cf-852e-4269-8c4a-19842fd6d28d", "b5bf432a-24d1-4333-b394-d98ed0b7a2b5", "ba282b96-2270-473b-8855-22d313c5511d", "d7e1253c-497c-4d3a-adc0-6920e77fa7c9", "da51d010-0c5c-4ea0-81cf-f2df8411f681", "e84629cd-3f79-4882-932b-58c8cab6b6a7", "ee4b3d9b-325f-4999-ba79-febddb6b4067"], "title": "Multi-guarded safe zone: An effective technique to monitor moving circular range queries", "venue": "international conference on data engineering", "year": 2010, "id": "b95b708f-456f-43e8-b7f9-ff0d6a482b24"}

{"abstract": "Subgraph querying has been applied in a variety of emerging applications. Traditional subgraph querying based on subgraph isomorphism requires identical label matching, which is often too restrictive to capture the matches that are semantically close to the query graphs. This paper extends subgraph querying to identify semantically related matches by leveraging ontology information. (1) We introduce the ontology-based subgraph querying, which revises subgraph isomorphism by mapping a query to semantically related subgraphs in terms of a given ontology graph. We introduce a metric to measure the similarity of the matches. Based on the metric, we introduce an optimization problem to find top K best matches. (2) We provide a filtering-and-verification framework to identify (top-K) matches for ontology-based subgraph queries. The framework efficiently extracts a small subgraph of the data graph from an ontology index, and further computes the matches by only accessing the extracted subgraph. (3) In addition, we show that the ontology index can be efficiently updated upon the changes to the data graphs, enabling the framework to cope with dynamic data graphs.

{"abstract": "We study the problem of efficiently extracting K entities, in a temporal database, which are most similar to a given search query. This problem is well studied in relational databases, where each entity is represented as a single record and there exist a variety of methods to define the similarity between a record and the search query. However, in temporal databases, each entity is represented as a sequence of historical records. How to properly define the similarity of each entity in the temporal database still remains an open problem. The main challenging is that, when a user issues a search query for an entity, he or she is prone to mix up information of the same entity at different time points. As a result, methods, which are used in relational databases based on record granularity, cannot work any further. Instead, we regard each entity as a set of \"virtual records\", where attribute values of a \"virtual record\" can be from different records of the same entity. In this paper, we propose a novel evaluation model, based on which the similarity between each \"virtual record\" and the query can be effectively quantified, and the maximum similarity of its \"virtual records\" is taken as the similarity of an entity. For each entity, as the number of its \"virtual records\" is exponentially large, calculating the similarity of the entity is challenging. As a result, we further propose a Dominating Tree Algorithm (DTA), which is based on the bounding-pruning-refining strategy, to efficiently extract K entities with greatest similarities. We conduct extensive experiments on both real and synthetic datasets. The encouraging results show that our model for defining the similarity between each entity and the search query is effective, and the proposed DTA can perform at least two orders of magnitude improvement on the performance comparing with the naive approach.", "authors": ["Wei Lu", "Gabriel Pui Cheong Fung", "Xiaoyong Du", "Xiaofang Zhou", "Lijiang Chen", "Ke Deng"], "references": ["035dfcbe-e49e-43e3-a5c4-327a1cd1edb3", "0552a6b3-4ee6-40d8-b19f-de447367e654", "073a8ca7-4c6e-4746-9ca7-62ec547b3e36", "0b5e0bfa-12ff-4175-9d65-d8cc62552ae6", "0c9e7597-9419-402a-96a9-1d79464e1fa7", "0e19007e-34f1-4665-b217-3e1a001215d6", "16f0ef8b-ae0f-4fba-9c75-c86612effd8a", "20dc9ae7-35a8-4950-af9e-80d1e1ac011a", "21062de9-7c86-4a41-b305-44da0b864de0", "270ff4fd-6bb4-494e-8380-450b21a32f64", "2e4ab172-bbc5-49f3-97ad-21e2c40b4315", "33834a31-132a-409b-b646-c8918a85afb0", "3583f5af-54a5-448e-987d-3b4c98b6b963", "3d05587a-6879-4d94-a7e5-edfb731d9d92", "45edc7b5-b219-4184-adb5-31cfeac96133", "4e505adb-9d71-484c-874c-45dbf3445708", "56859407-425a-4844-9680-f3eb2425b631", "5b89b791-1711-42bc-9743-f66b1e7effd4", "5d57c4fa-8dda-4e92-b42b-67f8d16f8602", "6b14556b-da32-48db-99d4-ad27965dbd17", "766fe457-6afd-49fb-8032-57e0b7d285a3", "90f1fc54-bc22-4cbf-90b0-0b220f507b37", "9de07dc8-eecd-47e2-a355-cbcebd55876a", "9ea36e2b-1368-49ba-93ab-521abd9f1983", "b572e1e5-ca30-4826-b052-8f91ec6aaf19", "b8a488b4-f4c3-4b01-a8e7-948e040411d9", "cd23e7f1-5c37-4bc1-82a1-41bab63f4ae2", "d6e410e9-11dc-4a0d-b40e-5a34f5a2e6cb", "d8450f5e-9274-4eb0-ab0a-124cf14c3561", "dd681afd-daf1-46b7-b71d-9d6ea8c93153", "e8415838-c2ce-4f51-a8f4-c22addc41552", "f1223f72-7059-4aa6-941a-3401d0de70d5"], "title": "Approximate entity extraction in temporal databases", "venue": "international world wide web conferences", "year": 2011, "id": "bc869cc5-201e-4481-bbaa-ed56fd35798d"}
{"abstract": "Concept-evolution has recently received a lot of attention in the context of mining data streams. Concept-evolution occurs when a new class evolves in the stream. Although many recent studies address this issue, most of them do not consider the scenario of recurring classes in the stream. A class is called recurring if it appears in the stream, disappears for a while, and then reappears again. Existing data stream classification techniques either misclassify the recurring class instances as another class, or falsely identify the recurring classes as novel. This increases the prediction error of the classifiers, and in some cases causes unnecessary waste in memory and computational resources. In this paper we address the recurring class issue by proposing a novel \"class-based\" ensemble technique, which substitutes the traditional \"chunk-based\" ensemble approaches and correctly distinguishes between a recurring class and a novel one. We analytically and experimentally confirm the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art techniques.", "authors": ["Tahseen Al-Khateeb", "Mohammad M. Masud", "Latifur Khan", "Charu C.

{"abstract": "In a typical Web recommendation system, objects are often described by many attributes. It also needs to serve many users with a diversified range of preferences. In other words, it must be capable to efficiently support high dimensional preference queries that allow the user to explore the data space effectively without imposing specific preference weightings for each dimension. The skyline query, which can produce a set of objects guaranteed to contain all top ranked objects for any linear attribute preference combination, has been proposed to support this type of recommendation applications. However, it suffers from the problem known as `dimensionality curse' as the size of skyline query result set can grow exponentially with the number of dimensions. Therefore, when the dimensionality is high, a large percentage of objects can become skyline points. This problem makes such a recommendation system less usable for users. In this paper, we propose a stronger type of skyline query, called core skyline query, that adopts a new quality measure called vertical dominance to return only an interesting subset of the traditional skyline points. An efficient query processing method is proposed to find core skyline points using a novel indexing structure called Linked Multiple B'-trees (LMB). Our approach can find such superior skyline points progressively without the need of computing the entire set of skyline points first.", "authors": ["Jing Yang", "Gabriel Pui Cheong Fung", "Wei Lu", "Xiaofang Zhou", "Hong Chen", "Xiaoyong Du"], "references": ["033237d3-a171-4f2d-b014-3f00fb4e72cb", "0c7aee54-b37d-4d8e-83a5-750cf8fb82f7", "12524a6d-5c65-437b-bf51-ecf38c0d25df", "12e9186a-268e-4ae7-ab83-6b9618790107", "135c2d66-c4eb-4795-9787-9f03677aa047", "1bd858fd-21b1-4882-bca6-7a0435a892ec", "1de7e197-2f44-49b6-a025-29ea7df57d8e", "2538706d-a08b-4e05-b488-999bc4467a97", "3778ca73-6596-4bca-9063-099cfd3f37e3", "39202f3c-0c19-46b4-ae39-a7e23619ec71", "3b16365d-956a-4e6a-9aba-1a73cc64511f", "44f92106-1306-4811-8b0a-e6d420eb229a", "456fbf19-ba49-49fc-80f4-18dfee06d16b", "45902f99-2bd5-4eea-a065-0f5edc86cf89", "4a9ebe82-468b-428e-b028-246f28822e2e", "4dee9c9d-0c21-444f-8ebc-feb857938417", "56d6f62e-41d8-4d01-80cb-a3eed8832800", "606667fd-9fe6-4c8f-8d6c-208f17c807f8", "6726c62c-ff87-46b9-9a24-10d89f41e8dd", "6b6fb250-bb2e-4d16-b2a6-9f1f4dbeba9f", "7685969a-2d82-4ea4-9fbd-07dac4f17d5f", "82553ffa-0e53-4813-b5c4-798f01623102", "8883354e-0804-412a-a8b9-398ef0301624", "8eed7176-519e-4ea5-8339-d096a887afc4", "a377c8e7-8070-4ba1-bc9f-0fcd1f74fa97", "a5cd0a60-052e-484b-ac64-23812bae9e41", "a766029a-4dd6-4b52-8c79-6daf6cdb5abd", "ab4922bc-16c0-4435-ac9f-0d6f03a46812", "abb182d2-47e9-4ec8-b712-4b1987e56009", "ad7907fe-b1c6-4151-b428-2dccacd897ae", "affc94dd-9fc9-4412-93ac-4196324ef24f", "b59b8428-571f-4c42-b403-2540d0081b44", "b7e63ab1-9c9c-4888-9d24-d60c97f34c29", "c151c527-744e-4128-b3bd-0a83087cf0f0", "c6b46be9-6713-4a6d-a399-536fc3bff840", "c88d0ba0-b726-4ebc-aef7-ad7068e3eaae", "c89489c1-f1bf-4ee6-b4af-5c3a7136587a", "d4b1e0b1-c950-4c50-a0a6-58b35e69326a", "d5eb76b6-c890-4acb-bce5-fd4c00b10931", "e0f9e24a-3dd4-4ee5-b879-975b8e40e09b", "f44759a2-891c-4b59-a784-a76a36f06167", "fbf5199c-d1d3-44e6-9742-2d5be67d25a5", "fce25d77-ca67-4be5-887b-3faa43b2cfbe"], "title": "Finding superior skyline points for multidimensional recommendation applications", "venue": "World Wide Web", "year": 2012, "id": "c16e8c30-f8bc-4c83-9c3b-1438bcea2ad7"}
{"abstract": "Huge amounts of search and browse log data has been accumulated in various search engines. Such massive search/browse log data, on the one hand, provides great opportunities to mine the wisdom of crowds and improve Web search as well as online advertisement. On the other hand, designing effective and efficient algorithms and tools to clean, model, and process large scale log data presents great challenges.   In this tutorial, we give a systematic survey on the applications, challenges, fundamental principles and state-of-the-art methods of mining large scale search and browse log data. We start with an introduction of search and browse log data and an overview of various log mining applications.

{"abstract": "Topic modeling has been proved to be an effective method for exploratory text mining. It is a common assumption of most topic models that a document is generated from a mixture of topics. In real-world scenarios, individual documents usually concentrate on several salient topics instead of covering a wide variety of topics. A real topic also adopts a narrow range of terms instead of a wide coverage of the vocabulary. Understanding this sparsity of information is especially important for analyzing user-generated Web content and social media, which are featured as extremely short posts and condensed discussions. In this paper, we propose a dual-sparse topic model that addresses the sparsity in both the topic mixtures and the word usage. By applying a \"Spike and Slab\" prior to decouple the sparsity and smoothness of the document-topic and topic-word distributions, we allow individual documents to select a few focused topics and a topic to select focused terms, respectively. Experiments on different genres of large corpora demonstrate that the dual-sparse topic model outperforms both classical topic models and existing sparsity-enhanced topic models. This improvement is especially notable on collections of short documents.", "authors": ["Tianyi Lin", "Wentao Tian", "Qiaozhu Mei", "Hong Cheng"], "references": ["083323df-0aaf-4a24-b8cd-f2e85b759a58", "0ad38f3e-8131-4287-9e62-2b2ae77f47f7", "13f342a4-7a6c-4f9e-834f-465beb977b6b", "15579499-42ff-45fb-9854-91dfaba9cb64", "1ab19309-b71b-4b97-aec9-0fa77dd98d44", "1e537a79-ee87-42e5-8f55-217d67ebd183", "3ca5d5c0-c976-4dd7-8f20-4c3edfd4a4d8", "447e2f4a-7bb3-4c56-a3a6-adf0ab37acce", "4d2eade0-7917-485d-842d-ed0c336e4e4d", "4ee10c46-0672-442d-8ce2-b7676ba98fd3", "5cccb930-3d05-497d-92bf-1c522c14a785", "74443d3f-772b-4568-9958-699e50382b4c", "75e6ea15-4885-4245-9c10-d99b0683d37c", "7c460e8e-5c9e-45f5-9d18-461f27fcef43", "aebb08b5-d731-40d0-8ec7-1341f3cfa9d4", "b65e2736-a61c-44d4-81dd-c5c5ff509b6b", "c4e36ccd-f03d-4506-b448-54e2ffc6402b", "c86e7645-598e-488b-89f3-229318208e41", "cf93558f-c1b2-4292-8284-1be8d4316af1", "d507592b-621b-47c8-a10d-29f9e9953393", "db757534-e96d-4757-a12e-792406f34b9e", "f0cb8dab-50e5-4f93-a7b6-b6aab05aba96", "f102a3e2-2c05-4cb8-8aa4-820c8238777d", "f2c0408a-4fda-4284-90cc-da9afe324c91", "f46191de-e812-4ff8-9151-0e1dcfc8ce9b"], "title": "The dual-sparse topic model: mining focused topics and focused terms in short text", "venue": "international world wide web conferences", "year": 2014, "id": "c448ea33-5f90-429b-aeef-7ccbd4ea2c18"}
{"abstract": "In recent years, much effort has been invested in analyzing social network data. However, it remains a great challenge to support interactive exploration of such huge amounts of data. In this paper, we propose Vesta, a system that enables visual exploration of social network data via tag clouds. Under Vesta, users can interactively explore and extract summaries of social network contents published in a certain spatial region during a certain period of time. These summaries are represented using a novel concept called hierarchical tag clouds, which allows users to zoom in/out to explore more specific/general tag summaries. In Vesta, the spatiotemporal data is split into partitions. A novel biclustering approach is applied for each partition to extract summaries, which are then used to construct a hierarchical latent Dirichlet allocation model to generate a topic hierarchy. At runtime, the topic hierarchies in the relevant partitions of the user-specified region are merged in a probabilistic manner to form tag hierarchies, which are used to construct interactive hierarchical tag clouds for visualization. The result of an extensive experimental study verifies the efficiency and effectiveness of Vesta.", "authors": ["Wei Kang", "Anthony K. H.

{"abstract": "Given a set of lists, where items of each list are sorted by the ascending order of their values, the objective of this paper is to figure out the common items that appear in all of the lists efficiently. This problem is sometimes known as common items extraction from sorted lists. To solve this problem, one common approach is to scan all items of all lists sequentially in parallel until one of the lists is exhausted. However, we observe that if the overlap of items across all lists is not high, such sequential access approach can be significantly improved. In this paper, we propose two algorithms, MergeSkip and MergeESkip, to solve this problem by taking the idea of skipping as many items of lists as possible. As a result, a large number of comparisons among items can be saved, and hence the efficiency can be improved. We conduct extensive analysis of our proposed algorithms on one real dataset and two synthetic datasets with different data distributions.

{"abstract": "The popularity of social media services has been innovating the way of information acquisition in modern society. Meanwhile, mass information is generated in every single day. To extract useful knowledge, much effort has been invested in analyzing social media contents, e.g., (emerging) topic discovery. With these findings, however, users may still find it hard to obtain knowledge of great interest in conformity with their preference. In this paper, we present a novel system which brings proper context to continuously incoming social media contents, such that mass information can be indexed, organized and analyzed around Wikipedia entities. Four data analytics tools are employed in the system. Three of them aim to enrich each Wikipedia entity by analyzing the relevant contents while the other one builds an information network among the most relevant Wikipedia entities. With our system, users can easily pinpoint valuable information and knowledge they are interested in, as well as navigate to other closely related entities through the information network for further exploration.", "authors": ["Wei Kang", "Anthony K.

{"abstract": "Although keyword query enables inexperienced users to easily search XML database with no specific knowledge of complex structured query languages or XML data schemas, the ambiguity of keyword query may result in generating a great number of results that may be classified into different types. For users, each result type implies a possible search intention. To improve the performance of keyword query, it is desirable to efficiently work out the most relevant result type from the data to be retrieved.   Several recent research works have focused on this interesting problem by using data schema information or pure IR-style statical information. However, this problem is still open due to some requirements. (1) The data to be retrieved may not contain schema information; (2) Relevant result types should be efficiently computed before keyword query evaluation; (3) The correlation between a result type and a keyword query should be measured by analyzing the distribution of relevant values and structures within the data. As we know, none of existing work satisfies the above three requirements together. To address the problem, we propose an estimation-based approach to compute the promising result types for a keyword query, which can help a user quickly narrow down to her specific information need. To speed up the computation, we designed new algorithms based on the indexes to be built.

{"abstract": "Topic models, which factor each document into different topics and represent each topic as a distribution of terms, have been widely and successfully used to better understand collections of text documents. However, documents are also associated with further information, such as the set of real-world entities mentioned in them. For example, news articles are usually related to several people, organizations, countries or locations. Since those associated entities carry rich information, it is highly desirable to build more expressive, entity-based topic models, which can capture the term distributions for each topic, each entity, as well as each topic-entity pair. In this paper, we therefore introduce a novel Entity Topic Model (ETM) for documents that are associated with a set of entities. ETM not only models the generative process of a term given its topic and entity information, but also models the correlation of entity term distributions and topic term distributions. A Gibbs sampling-based algorithm is proposed to learn the model.

We employ stream-based online learning methods to continuously classify runtime operator state into normal, alert, or failure, based on collected feature streams. We have implemented the online failure forecast system as part of the IBM system S stream processing system. Our experiments show that the on-line failure forecast system can achieve good prediction accuracy for a range of stream processing software failures, while imposing low overhead to the stream system.", "authors": ["Xiaohui Gu", "Spiros Papadimitriou", "Philip S.

{"abstract": "Finding latent patterns in high dimensional data is an important research problem with numerous applications. Existing approaches can be summarized into 3 categories: feature selection, feature transformation (or feature projection) and projected clustering. Being widely used in many applications, these methods aim to capture global patterns and are typically performed in the full feature space. In many emerging biomedical applications, however, scientists are interested in the local latent patterns held by feature subsets, which may be invisible via any global transformation. In this paper, we investigate the problem of finding local linear correlations in high dimensional data. Our goal is to find the latent pattern structures that may exist only in some subspaces. We formalize this problem as finding strongly correlated feature subsets which are supported by a large portion of the data points. Due to the combinatorial nature of the problem and lack of monotonicity of the correlation measurement, it is prohibitively expensive to exhaustively explore the whole search space. In our algorithm, CARE, we utilize spectrum properties and effective heuristic to prune the search space. Extensive experimental results show that our approach is effective in finding local linear correlations that may not be identified by existing methods.", "authors": ["Xiang Zhang", "Feng Pan", "Wei Wang"], "references": ["1b2978e6-cdf8-42fb-beb0-690759e4d562", "1b2c620b-777c-4fb2-a29c-33b37b8d8868", "1b8188e1-59a6-487f-b956-475140aa6466", "26d7ae5c-1442-4800-ad30-bc27ac06bcf3", "37773ba8-37ac-42b9-875e-009809645a58", "536bd7e6-f6d9-4541-a69f-f29c4f67892e", "8fc94b78-c162-46b2-9b3c-6b8cd3c6acc7", "95fdc823-57bc-4e49-8e5b-8fac0c4cfb7f", "98385f05-177f-4e63-a2f9-7ef90e22d2ef", "b0ae252c-6a8a-44c5-8385-753b9f85dfb7", "bb2fecf5-ccb4-4290-ad99-daf67c9d6923", "c64ba432-05b4-432d-8020-976120070f96", "ca4c2f96-7119-4b09-ac4d-70371ef6a082"], "title": "CARE: Finding Local Linear Correlations in High Dimensional Data", "venue": "international conference on data engineering", "year": 2008, "id": "ca8398fa-df83-423b-af44-e75165fb4679"}

OMS first maps the sentences of input documents onto an ontology, then links the given query to a specific node in the ontology, and finally extracts the summary from the sentences in the subtree rooted at the query node. By using the domain-related ontology, OMS can better capture the semantic relevance between the query and the sentences, and thus lead to better summarization results. As a byproduct, the final summary generated by OMS can be represented as a tree showing the hierarchical relationships of the extracted sentences.

{"abstract": "Patents are of crucial importance for businesses, because they provide legal protection for the invented techniques, processes or products. A patent can be held for up to 20 years. However, large maintenance fees need to be paid to keep it enforceable. If the patent is deemed not valuable, the owner may decide to abandon it by stopping paying the maintenance fees to reduce the cost. For large companies or organizations, making such decisions is difficult because too many patents need to be investigated. In this paper, we introduce the new patent mining problem of automatic patent maintenance prediction, and propose a systematic solution to analyze patents for recommending patent maintenance decision. We model the patents as a heterogeneous time-evolving information network and propose new patent features to build model for a ranked prediction on whether to maintain or abandon a patent. In addition, a network-based refinement approach is proposed to further improve the performance. We have conducted experiments on the large scale United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) database which contains over four million granted patents.

We find that the signs of links in the underlying social networks can be predicted with high accuracy, using models that generalize across this diverse range of sites. These models provide insight into some of the fundamental principles that drive the formation of signed links in networks, shedding light on theories of balance and status from social psychology; they also suggest social computing applications by which the attitude of one user toward another can be estimated from evidence provided by their relationships with other members of the surrounding social network.", "authors": ["Jure Leskovec", "Daniel P.

{"abstract": "In this big data era, huge amounts of spatial documents have been generated everyday through various location based services. Top- k  spatial keyword search is an important approach to exploring useful information from a spatial database. It retrieves  k  documents based on a ranking function that takes into account both textual relevance (similarity between the query and document keywords) and spatial relevance (distance between the query and document locations). Various hybrid indexes have been proposed in recent years which mainly combine the R-tree and the inverted index so that spatial pruning and textual pruning can be executed simultaneously. However, the rapid growth in data volume poses significant challenges to existing methods in terms of the index maintenance cost and query processing time.   In this paper, we propose a scalable integrated inverted index, named  I  3 , which adopts the Quadtree structure to hierarchically partition the data space into cells. The basic unit of  I  3  is the keyword cell, which captures the spatial locality of a keyword. Moreover, we design a new storage mechanism for efficient retrieval of keyword cell and preserve additional summary information to facilitate pruning. Experiments conducted on real spatial datasets (Twitter and Wikipedia) demonstrate the superiority of  I  3  over existing schemes such as IR-tree and S2I in various aspects: it incurs shorter construction time to build the index, it has lower index storage cost, it is order of magnitude faster in updates, and it is highly scalable and answers top- k  spatial keyword queries efficiently.", "authors": ["Dongxiang Zhang", "Kian-Lee Tan", "Anthony K.

{"abstract": "Online learning on a graph is appealing due to its efficiency. However, existing online learning algorithms on a graph are limited to binary classification. Moreover, they require accessing the full label information, where the label oracle needs to return the true class label after the learner makes classification of each node. In many application scenarios, we only have access to partial label information, where the label oracle will return a single bit indicating whether the prediction is correct or not, instead of the true class label. This is also known as bandit feedback. In this paper, to overcome the above limitations of existing online learning algorithms on a graph, we study online learning on a graph for multi-class node classification, in both the full information setting and the partial information setting. First, we present an online multi-class classification algorithm in the full information setting. It is based on function learning on a graph using the spectral information of the graph Laplacian. We show that it attains O (cd log T) regret bound, where T is the number of rounds in online learning, c is the number of classes, and d is the number of eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian used for learning. Second, we present an online multi-class classification algorithm with bandit feedback. We use upper-confidence bound technique to trade off the exploration and exploitation of label information. We show that it attains O (cd a#x221A;T log T) regret bound, which is only a a#x221A;T factor worse than the proposed algorithm in the full information setting.

{"abstract": "Influence maximization problem with applications to viral marketing has gained much attention. Underlying influence diffusion models affect influence maximizing nodes because they focus on difference aspect of influence diffusion. Nevertheless, existing diffusion models overlook two important aspects of real-world marketing - continuous trials and time restriction. This paper proposes a new realistic influence diffusion model called Continously activated and Time-restricted IC (CT-IC) model which generalizes the IC model by embedding the above two aspects. We first prove that CT-IC model satisfies two crucial properties -- monotonicity and submodularity. We then provide an efficient method for calculating exact influence spread when a social network is restricted to a directed tree and a simple path.

{"abstract": "Nowadays, microblogging services, e.g., Twitter, have played important roles in people's everyday lives. It enables users to publish and read text-based posts, known as \u201ctweets\u201d and interact with each other through re-tweeting or commenting. In the literature, many efforts have been devoted on exploiting the social property of Twitter. However, except the social component, Twitter itself has become an indispensable source for users to acquire useful information. To maximize its value, we expect to pay more attention on the media property of Twitter. To be good media, the first requirement is that it should provide an effective presentation of its news so that users are facilitated of reading. Currently, all tweets from followings are presented to the users and usually organized by their published timelines or coming sources. However, too few dimensions of presenting tweets hinder users from finding their interested information conveniently. In this demo, we presents \u201cTwitter+\u201d, which aims to enrich user's reading experiences in Twitter by providing multiple ways for them to explore tweets, such as keyword presentation, topic finding. It presents users an alternative interface to browse tweets more effectively.", "authors": ["Chen Liu", "Anthony K. H.

{"abstract": "In this paper, we study the problem of efficiently identifying K records that are most similar to a given query record, where the similarity is defined as: (1) for each record, we calculate the similarity score between the record and the query record over each individual attribute using a specific similarity function; (2) an aggregate function is utilized to combine these similarity scores with weights and the aggregated value is served as the similarity of the record. After similarities of all records have been computed, K records with the greatest similarities can further be identified. Under this framework, unfortunately, the computational cost will be extremely expensive when the cardinality of relation is large as computation of similarity for each record is required. As a result, in this paper, we propose two efficient algorithms, named ScanIndex and Top-Down (TD for short), to cope with this problem. With respect to ScanIndex, similarity scores that are equal to zero over individual attributes are free from computation. Based on ScanIndex, with respect to TD, similarity scores less than thresholds (rather than zero) over individual attributes are skipped, where these thresholds are improved dynamically over time. Experimental results demonstrate that, comparing with the naive approach, the performance can be improved by two orders of magnitude using ScanIndex and TD.", "authors": ["Wei Lu", "Jinchuan Chen", "Xiaoyong Du", "Jieping Wang", "Wei Pan"], "references": ["035dfcbe-e49e-43e3-a5c4-327a1cd1edb3", "0552a6b3-4ee6-40d8-b19f-de447367e654", "0ae143fc-1980-4262-9595-b6f65cdb0956", "0b5e0bfa-12ff-4175-9d65-d8cc62552ae6", "0c9e7597-9419-402a-96a9-1d79464e1fa7", "16f0ef8b-ae0f-4fba-9c75-c86612effd8a", "1a24e9c7-d0ce-4be4-8e3a-c849b4630851", "20dc9ae7-35a8-4950-af9e-80d1e1ac011a", "21062de9-7c86-4a41-b305-44da0b864de0", "33834a31-132a-409b-b646-c8918a85afb0", "45733544-0add-48e0-b388-d75c16b5a61a", "45edc7b5-b219-4184-adb5-31cfeac96133", "48fca8c7-d089-4ed0-b6c0-4338fb56fb4f", "49a7da53-82eb-41ab-9601-8fb48a02197d", "4e505adb-9d71-484c-874c-45dbf3445708", "55a589ce-d78c-4670-9aa5-86617489be22", "56859407-425a-4844-9680-f3eb2425b631", "59887ba4-9637-4c58-820e-b4ddecc873cb", "6b14556b-da32-48db-99d4-ad27965dbd17", "766fe457-6afd-49fb-8032-57e0b7d285a3", "80dfe03d-9e11-4207-9a08-8d6961fd48f3", "84f693b0-4d82-40fb-a505-c97b37cbc94f", "90f1fc54-bc22-4cbf-90b0-0b220f507b37", "9ea36e2b-1368-49ba-93ab-521abd9f1983", "b35967ec-91cc-42cc-8f3b-f2b549b38c8e", "b572e1e5-ca30-4826-b052-8f91ec6aaf19", "b8a488b4-f4c3-4b01-a8e7-948e040411d9", "bc869cc5-201e-4481-bbaa-ed56fd35798d", "c493830e-289a-4be6-90f8-fea068ba11ed", "d2def386-15b2-4b38-9fdf-16f9e3d1acf2", "d88f4bfe-042e-4d15-a2e3-de57c499b388", "dd681afd-daf1-46b7-b71d-9d6ea8c93153", "f1223f72-7059-4aa6-941a-3401d0de70d5"], "title": "Efficient top-K approximate searches against a relation with multiple attributes", "venue": "World Wide Web", "year": 2011, "id": "d907e73d-57d9-4ae7-a3b5-0c916d549666"}

{"abstract": "Vector Space Model (VSM) has been at the core of information retrieval for the past decades. VSM considers the documents as vectors in high dimensional space.In such a vector space, techniques like Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naive Bayes, etc., can be then applied for indexing and classification. However, in some cases, the dimensionality of the document space might be extremely large, which makes these techniques infeasible due to the  curse of dimensionality . In this paper, we propose a novel  Tensor Space Model  for document analysis. We represent documents as the second order tensors, or matrices. Correspondingly, a novel indexing algorithm called  Tensor Latent Semantic Indexing  (TensorLSI) is developed in the tensor space. Our theoretical analysis shows that TensorLSI is much more computationally efficient than the conventional Latent Semantic Indexing, which makes it applicable for extremely large scale data set.

{"abstract": "Similarity joins have attracted significant interest, with applications in geographical information systems, astronomy, marketing analyzes, and anomaly detection. However, all the past algorithms, although highly fine-tuned, suffer an output explosion if the query range is even moderately large relative to the local data density. Under such circumstances, the response time and the search effort are both almost quadratic in the database size, which is often prohibitive. We solve this problem by providing two algorithms that find a compact representation of the similarity join result, while retaining all the information in the standard join. Our algorithms have the following characteristics: (a) they are at least as fast as the standard similarity join algorithm, and typically much faster, (b) they generate significantly smaller output, (c) they provably lose no information, (d) they scale well to large data sets, and (e) they can be applied to any of the standard tree data structures.

{"abstract": "The 2011 Cricket World Cup final match was watched by around 135 million people. Such a huge viewership demands a great experience for users of online cricket portals. Many portals like espncricinfo.com host a variety of content related to recent matches including match reports and ball-by-ball commentaries. When reading a match report, reader experience can be significantly improved by augmenting (on demand) the event mentions in the report with detailed commentaries. We build an event linking system \\emph{CricketLinking} which first identifies event mentions from the reports and then links them to a set of balls. Finding linkable mentions is challenging because unlike entity linking problem settings, we do not have a concrete set of event entities to link to. Further, depending on the event type, event mentions could be linked to a single ball, or to a set of balls. Hence, identifying mention type as well as linking becomes challenging.

{"abstract": "Hybrid human/computer database systems promise to greatly expand the usefulness of query processing by incorporating the crowd for data gathering and other tasks. Such systems raise many implementation questions. Perhaps the most fundamental question is that the closed world assumption underlying relational query semantics does not hold in such systems. As a consequence the meaning of even simple queries can be called into question. Furthermore, query progress monitoring becomes difficult due to non-uniformities in the arrival of crowdsourced data and peculiarities of how people work in crowdsourcing systems. To address these issues, we develop statistical tools that enable users and systems developers to reason about query completeness. These tools can also help drive query execution and crowdsourcing strategies.

{"abstract": "Commercial tuple extraction systems have enjoyed some success to extract tuples by regarding HTML pages as tree structures and exploiting XPath queries to find attributes of tuples in the HTML pages. However, such systems would be vulnerable to small changes on the web pages.

Our system regards elements in the rendered page as spatial objects in the 2-D space and executes spatial joins to extract target elements. Since humans also identify an element in a web page by its relative spatial location, our system extracting elements by their spatial relationships could possibly be as robust as manual extraction and is far more robust than existing tuple extraction systems.", "authors": ["Wook-Shin Han", "Wooseong Kwak", "Hwanjo Yu"], "references": ["1607f79a-3392-4dd2-9e08-698a5d388b0f", "4a8db9e7-6c0b-45e5-bb1b-b255ccd5d2ed", "7f158e52-ecb7-4b83-ad46-1a9d4338359d", "7f5a7b12-0bc9-4fb1-a1c7-d31d91aaf86c", "af9d69d5-91c5-4315-bb5d-13b231292e87", "b990db6b-1adb-4961-b210-262e9b5b39c2", "d10f840c-1003-48b5-8aec-3ecc0957c658", "dbe5ae2e-bbc0-4508-8df5-3ec95c784fa8"], "title": "On supporting effective web extraction", "venue": "international conference on data engineering", "year": 2010, "id": "e85e2efa-af70-4d70-a7a3-eb8366f4be90"}
{"abstract": "Pattern mining is a fundamental problem that has a wide range of applications. In this paper, we study the problem of finding a minimum set of signature patterns that explain all data. In the problem, we are given objects where each object has an item set and a label. A pattern is called a signature pattern if all objects with the pattern have the same label. This problem has many interesting applications such as assertion mining in hardware design and identifying failure causes from various log data. We show that the previous pattern mining methods are not suitable for mining signature patterns and identify the problems. Then we propose a novel pattern enumeration method which we call Pattern Shrink. Our method is strongly coupled with another novel method that is very similar to finding a local optimum with a negligible loss in performance. Our proposed methods show a speedup of more than ten times over the previous methods. Our methods are flexible enough to be extended to mining high confidence patterns, instead of signature patterns.", "authors": ["Hyungsul Kim", "Sungjin Im", "Tarek F.

{"abstract": "Dynamic networks are structures with objects and links between the objects that vary in time. Temporal information in dynamic networks can be used to reveal many important phenomena such as bursts of activities in social networks and human communication patterns in email networks. In this area, one very important problem is to understand dynamic patterns of object roles. For instance, will a user become a peripheral node in a social network? Could a website become a hub on the Internet? Will a gene be highly expressed in gene-gene interaction networks in the later stage of a cancer? In this paper, we propose a novel approach that identifies the role of each object, tracks the changes of object roles over time, and predicts the evolving patterns of the object roles in dynamic networks. In particular, a probability model is proposed to extract latent features of object roles from dynamic networks. The extracted latent features are discriminative in learning object roles and are capable of characterizing network structures. The probability model is then extended to learn the dynamic patterns and make predictions on object roles. We assess our method on two data sets on the tasks of exploring how users' importance and political interests evolve as time progresses on dynamic networks. Overall, the extensive experimental evaluations confirm the effectiveness of our approach for identifying, analyzing and predicting object roles on dynamic networks.", "authors": ["Kang Li", "Suxin Guo", "Nan Du", "Jing Gao", "Aidong Zhang"], "references": ["05983a60-f1af-4cbb-8c7b-be205fc2d63b", "266fe2bc-554f-4292-a300-76d23df5376e", "2d326c12-1260-451c-8143-e94578583fb3", "5552eb7d-4710-4813-bc4e-f4e6eec1ba90", "88f9262f-74cb-4609-836b-5e69820ff875", "8d119f85-8a40-4aa8-9790-e6b0854a4dd3", "94fbaff2-23f6-4174-9c16-bf89e2e14b01", "9a3e62d9-2d53-41de-8db3-b896dce42ac3", "b255d51e-1330-4192-8b2c-4f08ed571fe9", "b5669efd-c60a-44d3-9d1d-6479ef1792c8", "b68e6982-981f-4207-9c6c-da0b4cc79ae4", "da14530e-ad23-49bb-884f-5e77e36907c7", "e9c56f45-b0dc-434b-83a2-e486ee6f88d6"], "title": "Learning, Analyzing and Predicting Object Roles on Dynamic Networks", "venue": "international conference on data mining", "year": 2013, "id": "ee2277a9-3009-40fb-83fc-9273058765ba"}

A new system called LI-Hadoop is built to implement LI-MR model based on Hadoop. Furthermore, we propose a new algorithm MR-LPA, which parallelizes LPA in order to mine community structure in large-scale networks.

{"abstract": "The Earth Mover's Distance, or EMD for short, has been proven to be effective for content-based image retrieval. However, due to the cubic complexity of EMD computation, it remains difficult to use EMD in applications with stringent requirement for efficiency. In this paper, we present our new system, called EUDEMON, which utilizes new techniques to support fast Online Video Frame Copy Detection based on the EMD. Given a group of registered frames as queries and a set of targeted detection videos, EUDEMON is capable of identifying relevant frames from the video stream in real time. The significant improvement on efficiency mainly relies on the primal-dual theory in linear programming and well-designed B+ tree filters for adaptive candidate pruning. Generally speaking, our system includes a variety of new features crucial to the deployment of EUDEMON in real applications. First, EUDEMON achieves high throughput even when a large number of queries are registered in the system. Second, EUDEMON contains self-optimization component to automatically enhance the effectiveness of the filters based on the recent content of the video stream.

{"abstract": "Fast service placement, finding a set of nodes with enough free capacity of computation, storage, and network connectivity, is a routine task in daily cloud administration. In this work, we formulate this as a subgraph matching problem. Different from the traditional setting, including approximate and probabilistic graphs, subgraph matching on data-center networks has two unique properties. (1) Node/edge labels representing vacant CPU cycles and network bandwidth change rapidly, while the network topology varies little. (2) There is a partial order on node/edge labels. Basically, one needs to place service in nodes with enough free capacity. Existing graph indexing techniques have not considered very frequent label updates, and none of them supports partial order on numeric labels. Therefore, we resort to a new graph index framework, Gradin, to address both challenges. Gradin encodes subgraphs into multi-dimensional vectors and organizes them with indices such that it can efficiently search the matches of a query's subgraphs and combine them to form a full match. In particular, we analyze how the index parameters affect update and search performance with theoretical results. Moreover, a revised pruning algorithm is introduced to reduce unnecessary search during the combination of partial matches. Using both real and synthetic datasets, we demonstrate that Gradin outperforms the baseline approaches up to 10 times.", "authors": ["Bo Zong", "Ramya Raghavendra", "Mudhakar Srivatsa", "Xifeng Yan", "Ambuj K.

{"abstract": "We study the problem of analyzing influence of various factors affecting individual messages posted in social media. The problem is challenging because of various types of influences propagating through the social media network that act simultaneously on any user. Additionally, the topic composition of the influencing factors and the susceptibility of users to these influences evolve over time. This problem has not been studied before, and off-the-shelf models are unsuitable for this purpose. To capture the complex interplay of these various factors, we propose a new non-parametric model called the Dynamic Multi-Relational Chinese Restaurant Process. This accounts for the user network for data generation and also allows the parameters to evolve over time. Designing inference algorithms for this model suited for large scale social-media data is another challenge. To this end, we propose a scalable and multi-threaded inference algorithm based on online Gibbs Sampling.

{"abstract": "Motivated by the task of vernacular news analysis using known news topics from national news-papers, we study the task of topic analysis, where given source datasets with observed topics, data items from a target dataset need to be assigned either to observed source topics or to new ones. Using Hierarchical Dirichlet Processes for addressing this task imposes unnecessary and often inappropriate generative assumptions on the observed source topics. In this paper, we explore Dirichlet Processes with partially observed groups (POG-DP). POG-DP avoids modeling the given source topics. Instead, it directly models the conditional distribution of the target data as a mixture of a Dirichlet Process and the posterior distribution of a Hierarchical Dirichlet Process with known groups and topics. This introduces coupling between selection probabilities of all topics within a source, leading to effective identification of source topics. We further improve on this with a Combinatorial Dirichlet Process with partially observed groups (POG-CDP) that captures finer grained coupling between related topics by choosing intersections between sources. We evaluate our models in three different real-world applications. Using extensive experimentation, we compare against several baselines to show that our model performs significantly better in all three applications.", "authors": ["Avinava Dubey", "Indrajit Bhattacharya", "Mrinal Kanti Das", "Tanveer A.

{"abstract": "Influence maximization is the problem of finding a set of influential users in a social network such that the expected spread of influence under a certain propagation model is maximized. Much of the previous work has neglected the important distinction between social influence and actual product adoption. However, as recognized in the management science literature, an individual who gets influenced by social acquaintances may not necessarily adopt a product (or technology), due, e.g., to monetary concerns. In this work, we distinguish between influence and adoption by explicitly modeling the states of being influenced and of adopting a product. We extend the classical Linear Threshold (LT) model to incorporate prices and valuations, and factor them into users' decision-making process of adopting a product. We show that the expected profit function under our proposed model maintains submodularity under certain conditions, but no longer exhibits monotonicity, unlike the expected influence spread function. To maximize the expected profit under our extended LT model, we employ an unbudgeted greedy framework to propose three profit maximization algorithms. The results of our detailed experimental study on three real-world datasets demonstrate that of the three algorithms, PAGE, which assigns prices dynamically based on the profit potential of each candidate seed, has the best performance both in the expected profit achieved and in running time.", "authors": ["Wei Lu", "Laks V.

{"abstract": "Recovering low-rank and sparse matrices from partial, incomplete or corrupted observations is an important problem in many areas of science and engineering. In this paper, we propose a scalable robust bilateral factorization (RBF) method to recover both structured matrices from missing and grossly corrupted data such as robust matrix completion (RMC), or incomplete and grossly corrupted measurements such as compressive principal component pursuit (CPCP). With the unified framework, we first present two robust trace norm regularized bilateral factorization models for RMC and CPCP problems, which can achieve an orthogonal dictionary and a robust data representation, simultaneously. Then, we apply the alternating direction method of multipliers to efficiently solve the RMC problems. Finally, we provide the convergence analysis of our algorithm, and extend it to address general CPCP problems.

{"abstract": "We present MobiMix, a road network based mix-zone framework to protect location privacy of mobile users traveling on road networks. An alternative and complementary approach to spatial cloaking based location privacy protection is to break the continuity of location exposure by introducing techniques, such as mix-zones, where no applications can trace user movements. However, existing mixzone proposals fail to provide effective mix-zone construction and placement algorithms that are resilient to timing and transition attacks. In MobiMix, mix-zones are constructed and placed by carefully taking into consideration of multiple factors, such as the geometry of the zones, the statistical behavior of the user population, the spatial constraints on movement patterns of the users, and the temporal and spatial resolution of the location exposure. In this demonstration, we first introduce a visualization of the location privacy risks of mobile users traveling on road networks and show how mixzone based anonymization breaks the continuity of location exposure to protect user location privacy.

{"abstract": "In the age of big data, key-value data updated by intensive write streams is increasingly common, e.g., in social event streams. To serve such data in a cost-effective manner, a popular new paradigm is to outsource it to the cloud and store it in a scalable key-value store while serving a large user base. Due to the limited trust in third-party cloud infrastructures, data owners have to sign the data stream so that the data users can verify the authenticity of query results from the cloud. In this paper, we address the problem of verifiable freshness for multi-version key-value data. We propose a memory-resident digest structure that utilizes limited memory effectively and can have efficient verification performance. The proposed structure is named IncBM-Tree because it can INCrementally build a Bloom filter-embedded Merkle Tree. We have demonstrated the superior performance of verification under small memory footprints for signing, which is typical in an outsourcing scenario where data owners and users have limited resources.", "authors": ["Yuzhe Tang", "Ling Liu", "Ting Wang", "Xin Hu", "Reiner Sailer", "Peter R.

{"abstract": "Recently, the focus of many novel search applications shifted from short keyword queries to verbose natural language queries. Examples include question answering systems and dialogue systems, voice search on mobile devices and entity search engines like Facebook's Graph Search or Google's Knowledge Graph. However the performance of textbook information retrieval techniques for such verbose queries is not as good as that for their shorter counterparts. Thus, effective handling of verbose queries has become a critical factor for adoption of information retrieval techniques in this new breed of search applications. Over the past decade, the information retrieval community has deeply explored the problem of transforming natural language verbose queries using operations like reduction, weighting, expansion, reformulation and segmentation into more effective structural representations. However, thus far, there was not a coherent and organized tutorial on this topic. In this tutorial, we aim to put together various research pieces of the puzzle, provide a comprehensive and structured overview of various proposed methods, and also list various application scenarios where effective verbose query processing can make a significant difference.", "authors": ["Manish Gupta", "Michael Bendersky"], "references": ["01c209d9-503c-4c43-810d-8cb0bb0caaa0", "0493f1bf-2d37-46dd-a147-d5304780c404", "0f4f2790-14a9-4524-8850-503aa094a6be", "1348bfcd-3678-4b9f-9d4c-da15d9be6b21", "1b2fe1ac-079d-45ac-a37e-53e8d526a563", "1c3c73e4-f0cb-436d-b18f-40527a28a2ea", "1d1bd26e-c910-45fa-b101-1b3aa665d99c", "1ec30f47-999d-4fa2-b8a0-70393a84c2ea", "2a385436-399a-405d-afaf-f7ae89e22b6a", "2a9e2f01-a5c5-41dd-abf5-a9a7cc3d6817", "2fbe4db3-ccbc-455e-a701-fca3a12071fb", "3167f124-d661-4850-a7aa-4b6bc1b52fac", "32d6eb8c-0fc2-42af-aff8-835621ca0906", "3bc249ad-c25a-4dbf-8b78-5cfc2ae0c358", "473c1bb2-8953-4a1c-9e59-56faf862fb38", "48dd5682-aafe-494a-8bea-e23d11be0da3", "4e85397c-5e73-460c-9610-f03c8c24d2da", "5b240f5c-c243-4e7a-ad38-39e1661bd340", "6262d235-2d93-45f0-8652-c819ccefcddf", "64ad8ff3-603e-4309-8742-b1e17e3583de", "69f25994-a9f8-4da0-9960-d74949b8214f", "6baa0f24-90ef-4680-ba9f-d81c4632333a", "74e794eb-b697-4d4a-b45a-f3f376013e33", "77e41194-c8bb-4e69-98c4-24136f22cbe8", "80082195-b0da-475a-872d-6a7fb2769c99", "852c5d30-f93e-4fbc-b8c6-f7be368f7a8d", "887a1181-eec3-410b-979c-767d34b3a83d", "88aac5cb-119b-4c92-8271-d94d51e18b90", "8db5bfda-8cdb-4bf6-8b67-f1eaf952ed85", "9781c97a-bfa1-466c-8c9c-7efdf822ef7c", "9b94b5ed-bb9d-4d0c-87b6-703ea088a850", "9f97f2f1-b064-4103-ae0d-f5351c1bda94", "ab4a7249-a68d-4bf3-862b-d0a7600378b7", "ac9a1e6b-1aa9-4c6d-bea8-0d0cbfff4798", "bceddbb5-9f10-41fc-a79a-de4bc9cb1c82", "c81e27d1-1633-44db-a7f0-c4188578f46c", "cfdab149-75c3-4aec-b87e-c72dc72e48f2", "db07e88f-fc08-415d-9e42-706cf4045584", "dcb0bd16-4d63-47da-8de6-08e2d309e128", "ddd12cb9-2447-4ed8-83a7-1d9879974bef", "df003a45-3dcf-4963-9ca5-1d8327385e33", "e362d30b-6439-4040-bd65-74304bfe4d7c", "ebe64918-0603-4834-bbb3-37c565b3b8dc", "f355c78a-3602-4f81-8dec-3f59c492ec5a", "f39b3056-29c0-40da-83fc-c3bc714d7a60", "faa47e04-f6d7-413f-b291-51ee5f417720"], "title": "Information Retrieval with Verbose Queries", "venue": "international acm sigir conference on research and development in information retrieval", "year": 2015, "id": "fbfbd589-8226-4164-9d97-f4dc3f274817"}
{"abstract": "In the real world, various systems can be modeled using heterogeneous networks which consist of entities of different types. Many problems on such networks can be mapped to an underlying critical problem of discovering top-K subgraphs of entities with rare and surprising associations. Answering such subgraph queries efficiently involves two main challenges: (1) computing all matching subgraphs which satisfy the query and (2) ranking such results based on the rarity and the interestingness of the associations among entities in the subgraphs. Previous work on the matching problem can be harnessed for a naive ranking-after-matching solution. However, for large graphs, subgraph queries may have enormous number of matches, and so it is inefficient to compute all matches when only the top-K matches are desired. In this paper, we address the two challenges of matching and ranking in top-K subgraph discovery as follows. First, we introduce two index structures for the network: topology index, and graph maximum metapath weight index, which are both computed offline. Second, we propose novel top-K mechanisms to exploit these indexes for answering interesting subgraph queries online efficiently. Experimental results on several synthetic datasets and the DBLP and Wikipedia datasets containing thousands of entities show the efficiency and the effectiveness of the proposed approach in computing interesting subgraphs.", "authors": ["Manish Gupta", "Jing Gao", "Xifeng Yan", "Hasan Cam", "Jiawei Han"], "references": ["05fadb61-949a-4984-8559-d12a51202c8d", "15451903-17be-4e9a-85ae-4fe70a5a2905", "1586f240-c480-47e1-9833-8ae2cdea1aae", "18722dde-bcb7-40d7-8772-23ea66865ca8", "348d74bc-f056-4c91-9e4d-fb0ccbcfd302", "376e716d-b067-47b2-b091-b8e6c879ba19", "4600f1c7-91e1-41a7-b08d-ea815702c33f", "4647fc76-7e1e-4447-91c0-3a8938dfba7f", "4b7eba30-9700-4801-818a-8976e3b72393", "4d730a68-42d3-4450-adfe-b84c3688e054", "59512bb8-c6e1-4d13-8015-b44dd09bea55", "5e1342a0-fa9b-4594-ae46-92f46f59269d", "5e86cb8a-07f5-4302-8433-2f5f498fd842", "66af02bc-ff71-4504-9425-53227b29573b", "9ac7f0c3-7b17-467a-a8a3-53f636fc0964", "9b6f39d5-5b8d-4a31-8f68-42a89ac80fd3", "9bd3b8dd-728e-4476-a3b8-f7b08f51bb78", "9f7035ad-75d0-4b1d-9d47-bbc7eb4c0b9e", "a081c77c-a04b-4ff9-b391-9cd2a9fc5a40", "a6eba538-c3a3-4a2c-a948-60d5c0cf7f78", "acecf9ba-65aa-4167-be07-db21f67120a9", "b336dab8-0c89-4100-896b-c01ada791b11", "b7872d2f-c3a2-49d2-a279-4a9976a28349", "ba191934-d7bf-4f98-acfd-937730ca80f7", "cede414d-501e-4247-a650-42240f00a401", "d880728d-23d5-435b-bd27-84e771a59d71", "dabe8a81-39a5-4154-921e-34f2a45817cd", "e80f399e-08af-42d6-9196-db1432adc5f7", "eaebb135-6781-45ad-97fd-74bd971fe498", "ec3e9291-cee8-43fd-abf7-932bd3335ee9"], "title": "Top-K interesting subgraph discovery in information networks", "venue": "international conference on data engineering", "year": 2014, "id": "fe8616c2-594a-4da7-9f3f-c8bb73c69d64"}
{"abstract": "Given a snapshot of a large graph, in which an infection has been spreading for some time, can we identify those nodes from which the infection started to spread? In other words, can we reliably tell who the culprits are? In this paper we answer this question affirmatively, and give an efficient method called NETSLEUTH for the well-known Susceptible-Infected virus propagation model. Essentially, we are after that set of seed nodes that best explain the given snapshot. We propose to employ the Minimum Description Length principle to identify the best set of seed nodes and virus propagation ripple, as the one by which we can most succinctly describe the infected graph. We give an highly efficient algorithm to identify likely sets of seed nodes given a snapshot. Then, given these seed nodes, we show we can optimize the virus propagation ripple in a principled way by maximizing likelihood. With all three combined, NETSLEUTH can automatically identify the correct number of seed nodes, as well as which nodes are the culprits. Experimentation on our method shows high accuracy in the detection of seed nodes, in addition to the correct automatic identification of their number. Moreover, we show NETSLEUTH scales linearly in the number of nodes of the graph.", "authors": ["B.

{"abstract": "Communications between individuals can be represented by (weighted, multi-) graphs. Many applications operate on communication graphs associated with telephone calls, emails, instant messages (IM), blogs, web forums, e-business relationships and so on. These applications include identifying repetitive fraudsters, message board aliases, multiusage of IP addresses, etc. Tracking electronic identities in communication networks can be achieved if we have a reliable \"signature\" for nodes and activities. While many examples of ad hoc signatures can be proposed for particular tasks, what is needed is a systematic study of the principles behind the usage of signatures for any task. We develop a formal framework for the use of signatures in communication graphs and identify three fundamental properties that are natural to signature schemes: persistence, uniqueness and robustness. We argue for the importance of these properties by showing how they impact a set of applications. We then explore several signature schemes - previously defined and new - in our framework and evaluate them on real data in terms of these properties. This provides insights into suitable signature schemes for desired applications. Finally, as case studies, we focus on two concrete applications in enterprise network traffic. We apply signature schemes to these problems and demonstrate their effectiveness.", "authors": ["Graham Cormode", "Flip Korn", "S.

{"abstract": "The success and popularity of social network systems, such as del.icio.us, Facebook, MySpace, and YouTube, have generated many interesting and challenging problems to the research community. Among others, discovering social interests shared by groups of users is very important because it helps to connect people with common interests and encourages people to contribute and share more contents. The main challenge to solving this problem comes from the difficulty of detecting and representing the interest of the users. The existing approaches are all based on the online connections of users and so unable to identify the common interest of users who have no online connections.   In this paper, we propose a novel social interest discovery approach based on user-generated tags. Our approach is motivated by the key observation that in a social network, human users tend to use descriptive tags to annotate the contents that they are interested in. Our analysis on a large amount of real-world traces reveals that in general, user-generated tags are consistent with the web content they are attached to, while more concise and closer to the understanding and judgments of human users about the content. Thus, patterns of frequent co-occurrences of user tags can be used to characterize and capture topics of user interests. We have developed an Internet Social Interest Discovery system, ISID, to discover the common user interests and cluster users and their saved URLs by different interest topics. Our evaluation shows that ISID can effectively cluster similar documents by interest topics and discover user communities with common interests no matter if they have any online connections.", "authors": ["Xin Li", "L.

{"abstract": "Recently, as more and more social network data has been published in one way or another, preserving privacy in publishing social network data becomes an important concern. With some local knowledge about individuals in a social network, an adversary may attack the privacy of some victims easily. Unfortunately, most of the previous studies on privacy preservation can deal with relational data only, and cannot be applied to social network data. In this paper, we take an initiative towards preserving privacy in social network data. We identify an essential type of privacy attacks: neighborhood attacks. If an adversary has some knowledge about the neighbors of a target victim and the relationship among the neighbors, the victim may be re-identified from a social network even if the victim's identity is preserved using the conventional anonymization techniques. We show that the problem is challenging, and present a practical solution to battle neighborhood attacks.

{"abstract": "Trust inference, which is the mechanism to build new pair-wise trustworthiness relationship based on the existing ones, is a fundamental integral part in many real applications, e.g., e-commerce, social networks, peer-to-peer networks, etc. State-of-the-art trust inference approaches mainly employ the transitivity property of trust by propagating trust along connected users (a.k.a. trust propagation), but largely ignore other important properties, e.g., prior knowledge, multi-aspect, etc.   In this paper, we propose a multi-aspect trust inference model by exploring an equally important property of trust, i.e., the multi-aspect property. The heart of our method is to view the problem as a recommendation problem, and hence opens the door to the rich methodologies in the field of collaborative filtering. The proposed multi-aspect model directly characterizes multiple latent factors for each trustor and trustee from the locally-generated trust relationships.

{"abstract": "We propose an efficient algorithm for mining frequent approximate sequential patterns under the Hamming distance model. Our algorithm gains its efficiency by adopting a \"break-down-and-build-up\" methodology. The \"breakdown\" is based on the observation that all occurrences of a frequent pattern can be classified into groups, which we call strands. We developed efficient algorithms to quickly mine out all strands by iterative growth. In the \"build-up\" stage, these strands are grouped up to form the support sets from which all approximate patterns would be identified. A salient feature of our algorithm is its ability to grow the frequent patterns by iteratively assembling building blocks of significant sizes in a local search fashion. By avoiding incremental growth and global search, we achieve greater efficiency without losing the completeness of the mining result. Our experimental studies demonstrate that our algorithm is efficient in mining globally repeating approximate sequential patterns that would have been missed by existing methods.", "authors": ["Feida Zhu", "Xifeng Yan", "Jiawei Han", "Philip S.

{"abstract": "Community detection is an important task for mining the structure and function of complex networks. Many pervious approaches are difficult to detect communities with arbitrary size and shape, and are unable to identify hubs and outliers. A recently proposed network clustering algorithm, SCAN, is effective and can overcome this difficulty. However, it depends on a sensitive parameter: minimum similarity threshold $\\varepsilon$, but provides no automated way to find it. In this paper, we propose a novel density-based network clustering algorithm, called gSkeletonClu (graph-skeleton based clustering). By projecting a network to its Core-Connected Maximal Spanning Tree (CCMST), the network clustering problem is converted to finding core-connected components in the CCMST. We discover that all possible values of the parameter $\\varepsilon$ lie in the edge weights of the corresponding CCMST. By means of tree divisive or agglomerative clustering, our algorithm can find the optimal parameter $\\varepsilon$ and detect communities, hubs and outliers in large-scale undirected networks automatically without any user interaction. Extensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic networks demonstrate the superior performance of gSkeletonClu over the baseline methods.", "authors": ["Heli Sun", "Jianbin Huang", "Jiawei Han", "Hongbo Deng", "Peixiang Zhao", "Boqin Feng"], "references": ["0a32020b-d21d-4fcc-b920-00324362cd4b", "126446a1-730e-44dc-858b-e5c768bd81ac", "2256cad0-cf03-42da-bcf3-4a89be0ebf8e", "803669d1-4f8e-47b2-b410-493a5cb17af7", "9438a773-c15c-4ef2-a97c-54f643ce6082", "9b5c0693-8425-4939-bfb5-9640003662c8", "9ba28bb7-e99a-491e-afb2-8b64b47a5d3b", "cede414d-501e-4247-a650-42240f00a401", "d15070cd-864c-49c4-8285-f7437d991557", "d9150c43-b726-4cd5-87ed-debc6c66d895", "e3a40536-5580-4c24-b273-4fa4dab2579e", "fa0e3a65-c218-4eff-bf8b-cf284855bb32"], "title": "gSkeletonClu: Density-Based Network Clustering via Structure-Connected Tree Division or Agglomeration", "venue": "international conference on data mining", "year": 2010, "id": "0636b743-a02f-420a-9c7a-3fcb3c31834c"}
{"abstract": "It is well recognized that data cubing often produces huge outputs. Two popular efforts devoted to this problem are (1) iceberg cube, where only significant cells are kept, and (2) closed cube, where a group of cells which preserve roll-up/drill-down semantics are losslessly compressed to one cell. Due to its usability and importance, efficient computation of closed cubes still warrants a thorough study. In this paper, we propose a new measure, called closedness, for efficient closed data cubing. We show that closedness is an algebraic measure and can be computed efficiently and incrementally. Based on closedness measure, we develop an an aggregation-based approach, called C-Cubing (i.e., Closed-Cubing), and integrate it into two successful iceberg cubing algorithms: MM-Cubing and Star-Cubing. Our performance study shows that C-Cubing runs almost one order of magnitude faster than the previous approaches.

{"abstract": "A protein is the product of a gene. From the gene expression data, we can find co-expressed genes, which are groups of genes that demonstrate coherent patterns on samples. On the other hand, from the protein interaction data, we can find groups of proteins that frequently interact with each other. If we can conduct a joint mining of both gene expression data and protein interaction data, then we may find the clusters of genes that are co-expressed and also their proteins interact. Such clusters found from the joint mining are interesting and meaningful for at least two reasons. First, both the gene expression data and the protein data are very noisy. The clusters confirmed by both data sets will strongly indicate the correlation/connection among the genes in a cluster. In other words, the clusters found from the joint mining are more reliable. We may thus have the high confidence that the genes in a cluster found as such are regulated by the same mechanism or belong to the same biological process. Second, although highly related, gene expression data and protein interaction data still carry different biological meaning. The coincidence of co-expressed genes and interacting proteins is biologically significant.

However, little attention has been paid to the patterns that are hidden in multiple relational graphs. One interesting pattern in relational graphs is frequent highly connected subgraph which can identify recurrent groups and clusters.

{"abstract": "One of the most challenging aspects of managing a very large data warehouse is identifying how queries will behave before they start executing. Yet knowing their performance characteristics --- their runtimes and resource usage --- can solve two important problems. First, every database vendor struggles with managing unexpectedly long-running queries. When these long-running queries can be identified before they start, they can be rejected or scheduled when they will not cause extreme resource contention for the other queries in the system. Second, deciding whether a system can complete a given workload in a given time period (or a bigger system is necessary) depends on knowing the resource requirements of the queries in that workload. We have developed a system that uses machine learning to accurately predict the performance metrics of database queries whose execution times range from milliseconds to hours. For training and testing our system, we used both real customer queries and queries generated from an extended set of TPC-DS templates. The extensions mimic queries that caused customer problems. We used these queries to compare how accurately different techniques predict metrics such as elapsed time, records used, disk I/Os, and message bytes. The most promising technique was not only the most accurate, but also predicted these metrics simultaneously and using only information available prior to query execution. We validated the accuracy of this machine learning technique on a number of HP Neoview configurations. We were able to predict individual query elapsed time within 20% of its actual time for 85% of the test queries. Most importantly, we were able to correctly identify both the short and long-running (up to two hour) queries to inform workload management and capacity planning.", "authors": ["Archana Ganapathi", "Harumi A.

{"abstract": "A Cyber-Physical System (CPS) integrates physical devices (e.g., sensors, cameras) with cyber (or informational)components to form a situation-integrated analytical system that responds intelligently to dynamic changes of the real-world scenarios. One key issue in CPS research is trustworthiness analysis of the observed data: Due to technology limitations and environmental influences, the CPS data are inherently noisy that may trigger many false alarms. It is highly desirable to sift meaningful information from a large volume of noisy data. In this paper, we propose a method called Tru-Alarm which finds out trustworthy alarms and increases the feasibility of CPS. Tru-Alarm estimates the locations of objects causing alarms, constructs an object-alarm graph and carries out trustworthiness inferences based on linked information in the graph. Extensive experiments show that Tru-Alarm filters out noises and false information efficiently and guarantees not missing any meaningful alarms.", "authors": ["Lu An Tang", "Xiao Yu", "Sangkyum Kim", "Jiawei Han", "Chih-Chieh Hung", "Wen-Chih Peng"], "references": ["33d2d4e5-0e0a-4790-a989-b38e80b14ba3", "35762501-40ea-4ff0-b856-4ab58b745891", "8395dac0-198a-4ab7-9332-0ac7fa348bbf", "8bf2957f-a46a-4ffb-9dd6-181a2a144bf3", "8f1396bc-f60d-42e8-8ea1-6fbe9fccc726", "a98551ed-0f60-4a9c-8de2-7ee238c7ca65", "c58cf94d-c540-4d1d-b01c-0bf009e944de"], "title": "Tru-Alarm: Trustworthiness Analysis of Sensor Networks in Cyber-Physical Systems", "venue": "international conference on data mining", "year": 2010, "id": "11ac53a6-7930-47c4-a7ba-7d82fa742672"}
{"abstract": "In some E-commerce recommender systems, a special class of recommendation involves recommending items to users in a life cycle. For example, customers who have babies will shop on Amazon within a relatively long period, and purchase different products for babies within different growth stages. Traditional recommendation algorithms cannot effectively resolve the situation with a life cycle. In this paper, we model users' behavior with life cycles by employing hand-crafted item taxonomies, of which the background knowledge can be tailored for the computation of personalized recommendation. In particular, our method first formalizes a user's long-term behavior using the item taxonomy, and then identify the exact stage of this user. By incorporating collaborative filtering into our method, we can easily provide a personalized item list to this user through other similar users within the same stage. An empirical evaluation conducted on a purchasing data collection obtained from Amazon demonstrates the efficacy of our proposed method.", "authors": ["Lei Li", "Wenxing Hong", "Tao Li"], "references": ["0197a6a8-a2f8-4586-85bc-b60eb13ba570", "0227a7bb-e654-4373-9fda-fd5ba5ef0068", "32717de3-dca0-4fac-8691-9954e0897d54", "3be2ed7e-9c26-45f9-82aa-5ce8bdaae4c0", "3c39782e-3691-4fbb-bcec-370257910ade", "41350086-4320-45bb-a93c-be68975bfff5", "4a23bcc9-2320-4889-b7c3-6c01f4204051", "65921aa5-8a09-4da2-9575-797546c5829c", "696ef122-bd98-4ef6-bfec-82120a5c1cff", "6e425bce-a497-4c63-9eb0-b038e660a54f", "892d5d27-8e30-4ab2-b157-3eb1639e2a1d", "8b04d095-b24f-495a-a706-6356f19d6176", "a2c91880-6b5d-466c-bb04-bf46f6d0198a", "b462799d-6c47-4838-8f1d-279ebda44f42", "c0f1cb2b-e1ad-4ae2-abc0-c63b3389fef4", "d3ec5b39-7147-440d-82b0-4c4d05e671c9"], "title": "Taxonomy-Oriented recommendation towards recommendation with stage", "venue": "asia-pacific web conference", "year": 2012, "id": "11ececab-25f3-4c35-b806-a0296a811e81"}
{"abstract": "Different from a large body of research on social networks that has focused almost exclusively on positive relationships, we study signed social networks with both positive and negative links. Specifically, we focus on how to reliably and effectively predict the signs of links in a newly formed signed social network (called a target network). Since usually only a very small amount of edge sign information is available in such newly formed networks, this small quantity is not adequate to train a good classifier. To address this challenge, we need assistance from an existing, mature signed network (called a source network) which has abundant edge sign information. We adopt the transfer learning approach to leverage the edge sign information from the source network, which may have a different yet related joint distribution of the edge instances and their class labels.   As there is no predefined feature vector for the edge instances in a signed network, we construct generalizable features that can transfer the topological knowledge from the source network to the target. With the extracted features, we adopt an AdaBoost-like transfer learning algorithm with instance weighting to utilize more useful training instances in the source network for model learning. Experimental results on three real large signed social networks demonstrate that our transfer learning algorithm can improve the prediction accuracy by 40% over baseline methods.", "authors": ["J.B.

{"abstract": "The Affinity Propagation (AP) clustering algorithm proposed by Frey and Dueck (2007) provides an understandable, nearly optimal summary of a data set. However, it suffers two major shortcomings: i) the number of clusters is vague with the user-defined parameter called self-confidence, and ii) the quadratic computational complexity. When aiming at a given number of clusters due to prior knowledge, AP has to be launched many times until an appropriate setting of self-confidence is found. The re-launched AP increases the computational cost by one order of magnitude. In this paper, we propose an algorithm, called K-AP, to exploit the immediate results of K clusters by introducing a constraint in the process of message passing. Through theoretical analysis and experimental validation, K-AP was shown to be able to directly generate K clusters as user defined, with a negligible increase of computational cost compared to AP. In the meanwhile, KAP preserves the clustering quality as AP in terms of the distortion. K-AP is more effective than k-medoids w.r.t. the distortion minimization and higher clustering purity.", "authors": ["Xiangliang Zhang", "Wei Wang", "Kjetil N\u00f8rv\u00e5g", "Mich\u00e8le Sebag"], "references": ["24902bc1-0b86-4959-93f3-6c62a56b69ed", "8cea470a-9c6d-4137-8f4c-acda7e0d1904", "9ffac7fb-666f-4a98-a2a1-09334d05e814", "bdb8d83d-1771-4399-b593-d43be5a9f892", "de322ef7-795c-48a7-adaa-6c2300752c08"], "title": "K-AP: Generating Specified K Clusters by Efficient Affinity Propagation", "venue": "international conference on data mining", "year": 2010, "id": "13e4992f-cd12-4541-a515-2bcac55c76cf"}
{"abstract": "Recently, there arise a large number of graphs with massive sizes and complex structures in many new applications, such as biological networks, social networks, and the Web, demanding powerful data mining methods. Due to inherent noise or data diversity, it is crucial to address the issue of approximation, if one wants to mine patterns that are potentially interesting with tolerable variations. In this paper, we investigate the problem of mining frequent approximate patterns from a massive network and propose a method called gApprox. gApprox not only finds approximate network patterns, which is the key for many knowledge discovery applications on structural data, but also enriches the library of graph mining methodologies by introducing several novel techniques such as: (1) a complete and redundancy-free strategy to explore the new pattern space faced by gApprox; and (2) transform \"frequent in an approximate sense\" into an anti-monotonic constraint so that it can be pushed deep into the mining process. Systematic empirical studies on both real and synthetic data sets show that frequent approximate patterns mined from the worm protein-protein interaction network are biologically interesting and gApprox is both effective and efficient.", "authors": ["Chen Chent", "Xifeng Yan", "Feida Zhu", "Jiawei Han"], "references": ["0d239ae3-a7bf-4acf-9cf9-632246e20666", "2dbd1339-2b25-492f-b7ea-091b8a1d9bbb", "376e716d-b067-47b2-b091-b8e6c879ba19", "37a5c51f-cf19-42c9-aef6-d87c973ef4b4", "6bbde62a-dce6-414e-8eda-fbc800afb477", "6d2de9be-4055-4fcf-927d-a67d4ef3aa93", "88d69a2b-48c8-4118-b342-1e1ed647fec3", "c7a48515-84bd-435c-bd54-6ed5e940eb2f", "fa5c0aa9-6814-4253-a099-57287c2505f7", "fabf6595-1331-4f1a-a6e0-24e1001a1fe7"], "title": "gApprox: Mining Frequent Approximate Patterns from a Massive Network", "venue": "international conference on data mining", "year": 2007, "id": "143e54a4-ee7a-454d-8085-bbaf35f86ddd"}
{"abstract": "Many applications use classification models on streaming data to detect actionable alerts. Due to concept drifts in the underlying data, how to maintain a model's up-to-dateness has become one of the most challenging tasks in mining data streams. State of the art approaches, including both the incrementally updated classifiers and the ensemble classifiers, have proved that model update is a very costly process. In this paper, we introduce the concept of model granularity. We show that reducing model granularity will reduce model update cost. Indeed, models of fine granularity enable us to efficiently pinpoint local components in the model that are affected by the concept drift. It also enables us to derive new components that can easily integrate with the model to reflect the current data distribution, thus avoiding expensive updates on a global scale. Experiments on real and synthetic data show that our approach is able to maintain good prediction accuracy at a fraction of model updating cost of state of the art approaches.", "authors": ["Peng Wang", "Haixun Wang", "Xiaochen Wu", "Wei Wang", "Baile Shi"], "references": ["06e17da3-977f-4508-8cb2-d9b4e8bd780f", "16fc7618-0d11-4606-85f2-a9ca50a5150d", "338bc031-7663-4220-931a-70fb1cb5aecd", "4f0c5bed-66ce-47a9-a4ad-d0249933986f", "599bcbd7-64ae-4bb7-97bf-452c88486893", "5b68c863-e411-4f8a-b8bb-b07f5a33437e", "64c52060-f573-4a4c-9d15-029997df0813", "86f9af44-3bd9-4862-aa0c-2c3e891f5807", "9d14edff-0451-4315-9967-383c2c2e5b23", "b1953bd6-1273-4982-9386-92bb74cf589d", "c512fe3b-b9c4-40a1-a205-8ca01effdeb0", "cbec2519-f41d-418a-bbdb-c85869e1fdcb", "ce60ea5e-1cdb-415a-9c56-231db02111c4", "f09431dd-0dc4-4a43-aaf3-9fa6de6012d1"], "title": "On reducing classifier granularity in mining concept-drifting data streams", "venue": "international conference on data mining", "year": 2005, "id": "14ed1e83-45e7-4ace-9068-f16ec5d9024e"}

In general, products with sampling option enjoy a higher conversion rate (which leads to better sales) than those without sampling because sampling decreases the uncertainty of consuming experience goods.

{"abstract": "The problem of identifying user intent has received considerable attention in recent years, particularly in the context of improving the search experience via query contextualization. Intent can be characterized by multiple dimensions, which are often not observed from query words alone. Accurate identification of Intent from query words remains a challenging problem primarily because it is extremely difficult to discover these dimensions. The problem is often significantly compounded due to lack of representative training sample. We present a generic, extensible framework for learning the multi-dimensional representation of user intent from the query words. The approach models the latent relationships between facets using tree structured distribution which leads to an efficient and convergent algorithm, FastQ, for identifying the multi-faceted intent of users based on just the query words. We also incorporated WordNet to extend the system capabilities to queries which contain words that do not appear in the training data.

In this paper, we propose a novel general framework for adaptive and online detection of web attacks. The general framework can be based on any online clustering methods.

Str-DBSCAN that we extended DBSCAN to streaming data as well as StrAP are both used to validate the framework. The detection model based on the framework automatically labels the web audit data and adapts to normal behavior changes while identifies attacks through dynamical clustering of the streaming data.

{"abstract": "In a large weighted graph, how can we detect suspicious sub graphs, patterns, and outliers? A suspicious pattern could be a near-clique or a set of nodes bridging two or more near-cliques. This would improve intrusion detection in computer networks and network traffic monitoring. Are there other network patterns that need to be detected? We propose EigenDiagnostics, a fast algorithm that spots such patterns. The process creates scatter-plots of the node properties (such as eigenscores, degree, and weighted degree), then looks for linear-like patterns. Our tool automatically discovers such plots, using the Hough transform from machine vision. We apply EigenDiagnostics on a wide variety of synthetic and real data (LBNL computer traffic, movie-actor data from IMDB, Patent citations, and more). EigenDiagnostics finds surprising patterns. They appear to correspond to port-scanning (in computer networks), repetitive tasks with bot-net-like behavior, strange \u0081gbridges\u0081h in movie-actor data (due to actors changing careers, for example), and more. The advantages are: (a) it is effective in discovering surprising patterns.

{"abstract": "Labeling schemes lie at the core of query processing for many tree-structured data such as XML data that is flooding the web. A labeling scheme that can simultaneously and efficiently support various relationship queries on trees (such as parent/children, descendant/ancestor, etc.), computation of lowest common ancestors (LCA) and update of trees, is desired for effective and efficient management of tree-structured data. Although a variety of labeling schemes such as prefix-based labeling, interval-based labeling and prime-based labeling as well as their variants have been available to us for encoding static and dynamic trees, these labeling schemes usually show weakness in one aspect or another. In this paper, we propose an integer-based labeling scheme \\emph{branch code} as well as its compressed version as our major solution to simultaneously support efficient query processing on both static and dynamic ordered trees with affordable storage cost. The proposed branch code can answer common queries on ordered trees in constant time, which comes at the cost of consuming $O(N\\log N)$ storage. To reduce storage cost to $O(N)$, a compressed branch code is further developed. We also give a relationship determination algorithm purely using compressed branch code, which is of quite low possibility to produce false positive results as verified by experimental results. With the support of splay trees, branch code can also support dynamic trees so that updates and queries can be implemented with $O(\\log N)$ amortized cost.

It is commonly believed that web search click logs are a gold mine for search business, because they reflect users' preference over web documents presented by the search engine. Click models provide a principled approach to inferring user-perceived relevance of web documents, which can be leveraged in numerous applications in search businesses. Due to the huge volume of click data, scalability is a must.   We present the click chain model (CCM), which is based on a solid, Bayesian framework. It is both scalable and incremental, perfectly meeting the computational challenges imposed by the voluminous click logs that constantly grow. We conduct an extensive experimental study on a data set containing 8.8 million query sessions obtained in July 2008 from a commercial search engine.

{"abstract": "Recent approaches in classifying evolving data streams are based on supervised learning algorithms, which can be trained with labeled data only. Manual labeling of data is both costly and time consuming. Therefore, in a real streaming environment, where huge volumes of data appear at a high speed, labeled data may be very scarce. Thus, only a limited amount of training data may be available for building the classification models, leading to poorly trained classifiers. We apply a novel technique to overcome this problem by building a classification model from a training set having both unlabeled and a small amount of labeled instances. This model is built as micro-clusters using semi-supervised clustering technique and classification is performed with kappa-nearest neighbor algorithm. An ensemble of these models is used to classify the unlabeled data. Empirical evaluation on both synthetic data and real botnet traffic reveals that our approach, using only a small amount of labeled data for training, outperforms state-of-the-art stream classification algorithms that use twenty times more labeled data than our approach.", "authors": ["Mohammad M.

{"abstract": "Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) has been a popular method for extracting features which preserve class separability. The projection vectors are commonly obtained by maximizing the between class covariance and simultaneously minimizing the within class covariance. LDA can be performed either in the original input space or in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) into which data points are mapped, which leads to Kernel Discriminant Analysis (KDA). When the data are highly nonlinear distributed, KDA can achieve better performance than LDA. However, computing the projective functions in KDA involves eigen-decomposition of kernel matrix, which is very expensive when a large number of training samples exist. In this paper, we present a new algorithm for kernel discriminant analysis, called spectral regression kernel discriminant analysis (SRKDA). By using spectral graph analysis, SRKDA casts discriminant analysis into a regression framework which facilitates both efficient computation and the use of regularization techniques. Specifically, SRKDA only needs to solve a set of regularized regression problems and there is no eigenvector computation involved, which is a huge save of computational cost. Our computational analysis shows that SRKDA is 27 times faster than the ordinary KDA. Moreover, the new formulation makes it very easy to develop incremental version of the algorithm which can fully utilize the computational results of the existing training samples. Experiments on face recognition demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm.", "authors": ["Deng Cai", "Xiaofei He", "Jiawei Han"], "references": ["10ebbda8-d881-4c11-9d71-a7448d3b384e", "2396f643-6810-4c1f-859a-7247962ad4e4", "7c7b46d7-9a1f-4da8-94c6-e9b090820349", "91979159-37d8-410f-a245-a33ef80a092b", "977d5066-11f7-473e-befe-b140db86c3ce", "c1b6b493-01ef-420f-be44-7bacfe34e846", "d5a16e9b-014c-4528-a32d-83610f03cadb", "f00fc370-0854-4967-bc6a-83b6c49da8bf", "fffb25d4-1481-4b8d-880c-4d59a3abb122"], "title": "Efficient Kernel Discriminant Analysis via Spectral Regression", "venue": "international conference on data mining", "year": 2007, "id": "28436473-878c-4ee0-935d-c538eed06ea3"}
{"abstract": "In online social media systems users are not only posting, consuming, and resharing content, but also creating new and destroying existing connections in the underlying social network. While each of these two types of dynamics has individually been studied in the past, much less is known about the connection between the two. How does user information posting and seeking behavior interact with the evolution of the underlying social network structure? Here, we study ways in which network structure reacts to users posting and sharing content. We examine the complete dynamics of the Twitter information network, where users post and reshare information while they also create and destroy connections. We find that the dynamics of network structure can be characterized by steady rates of change, interrupted by sudden bursts. Information diffusion in the form of cascades of post re-sharing often creates such sudden bursts of new connections, which significantly change users' local network structure. We also explore the effect of the information content on the dynamics of the network and find evidence that the appearance of new topics and real-world events can lead to significant changes in edge creations and deletions.

{"abstract": "Nearest neighbor (NN) search in high dimensional space is an essential query in many multimedia retrieval applications. Due to the curse of dimensionality, existing index structures might perform even worse than a simple sequential scan of data when answering exact NN query. To improve the efficiency of NN search, locality sensitive hashing (LSH) and its variants have been proposed to find approximate NN. They adopt hash functions that can preserve the Euclidean distance so that similar objects have a high probability of colliding in the same bucket. Given a query object, candidate for the query result is obtained by accessing the points that are located in the same bucket. To improve the precision, each hash table is associated with m hash functions to recursively hash the data points into smaller buckets and remove the false positives. On the other hand, multiple hash tables are required to guarantee a high retrieval recall. Thus, tuning a good tradeoff between precision and recall becomes the main challenge for LSH. Recently, locality sensitive B-tree(LSB-tree) has been proposed to ensure both quality and efficiency. However, the index uses random I/O access. When the multimedia database is large, it requires considerable disk I/O cost to obtain an approximate ratio that works in practice. In this paper, we propose a novel index structure, named HashFile, for efficient retrieval of multimedia objects. It combines the advantages of random projection and linear scan. Unlike the LSH family in which each bucket is associated with a concatenation of m hash values, we only recursively partition the dense buckets and organize them as a tree structure. Given a query point q, the search algorithm explores the buckets near the query object in a top-down manner. The candidate buckets in each node are stored sequentially in increasing order of the hash value and can be efficiently loaded into memory for linear scan. HashFile can support both exact and approximate NN queries. Experimental results show that HashFile performs better than existing indexes both in answering both types of NN queries.", "authors": ["Dongxiang Zhang", "Divyakant Agrawal", "Gang Chen", "Anthony K.

We observe that the proximity of sequences of 3 to 5 terms is most effective for long queries, while shorter or longer sequences appear less useful.

Our method (ProSIN) is motivated by the well-studied random walk with restart (RWR).

Our case studies demonstrate that ProSIN is well-suited in a variety of applications, including neighborhood search, center-piece subgraphs, and image caption. Given the potential computational complexity of ProSIN, we also propose a fast algorithm (Fast-ProSIN) that exploits the smoothness of the graph structures with/without side information.

{"abstract": "Recommending news articles has become a promising research direction as the Internet provides fast access to real-time information from multiple sources around the world.

In this paper, we propose a scalable two-stage personalized news recommendation approach with a two-level representation, which considers the exclusive characteristics (e.g., news content, access patterns, named entities, popularity and recency) of news items when performing recommendation. Also, a principled framework for news selection based on the intrinsic property of user interest is presented, with a good balance between the novelty and diversity of the recommended result. Extensive empirical experiments on a collection of news articles obtained from various news websites demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of our approach.", "authors": ["Lei Li", "Dingding Wang", "Tao Li", "Daniel Knox", "Balaji Padmanabhan"], "references": ["07e1240a-bc65-42e5-8762-a86809c28eab", "09880ee2-8770-4f53-96d0-90eaa4d3133d", "238c36bc-4ec4-42e1-baf8-e6f8ba55a379", "2616451f-9c95-4137-8868-459a58df74e5", "28903e7b-aa3b-4840-b634-916029ed6c77", "2e0c0709-138c-461c-af4f-64037b7feee4", "30119eca-9d54-4d87-88b0-04cadda25ea0", "32717de3-dca0-4fac-8691-9954e0897d54", "382a6316-2a4e-41a9-8232-29f80a841db2", "3960350c-fc91-4fae-83f3-69899d9c8a6f", "41350086-4320-45bb-a93c-be68975bfff5", "5ce597b5-4c44-42c9-8128-30e360dc3bca", "9237593c-446e-47da-a3af-216ceec49608", "98b23182-8f51-428a-a4af-a91d280471ca", "98e67229-36db-4902-af27-db2195f85f57", "a69adad1-7efb-4204-93de-97aaeed2424a", "bff7828e-8d95-4e45-87c0-e420272ceb41", "c19e94a6-b1dc-4f54-8dd2-1935aa7e7cf9", "c69ef004-087e-486c-97c9-9b4587d0b10a", "d1fcfcd1-faa8-4ba3-a0d2-50fb53a9f47f", "e28644d3-3deb-4378-94c2-28c31cbf3e0c", "e54598e4-95e9-40ac-813d-ed986a53f6df"], "title": "SCENE: a scalable two-stage personalized news recommendation system", "venue": "international acm sigir conference on research and development in information retrieval", "year": 2011, "id": "319376f6-dda0-46b4-8ad2-92fa667ec9d5"}
{"abstract": "Recently, the skyline computation and analysis have been extended from one single full space to multidimensional subspaces, which can lead to valuable insights in some applications. Particularly, compressed skyline cubes in the form of skyline groups and their decisive subspaces provide a succinct summarization and compression of multidimensional subspace skylines. However, computing skyline cubes remains a challenging task since the existing methods have to search an exponential number of nonempty subspaces for subspace skylines. In this paper, we propose a novel and efficient method, Stellar, which exploits an interesting skyline group lattice on a small subset of objects which are in the skyline of the full space. We show that this skyline group lattice is easy to compute and can be extended to the skyline group lattice on all objects. After computing the skyline in the full space, Stellar only needs to enumerate skyline groups and their decisive subspaces using the full space skyline objects. Avoiding searching for skylines in an exponential number of subspaces improves the efficiency and the scalability of subspace skyline computation substantially in practice. An extensive performance study verifies the merits of our new method.", "authors": ["Jian Pei", "Ada Wai-Chee Fu", "Xuemin Lin", "Haixun Wang"], "references": ["033237d3-a171-4f2d-b014-3f00fb4e72cb", "4a9ebe82-468b-428e-b028-246f28822e2e", "56d6f62e-41d8-4d01-80cb-a3eed8832800", "723165be-6207-4bcb-8b98-6dee09464e37", "7685969a-2d82-4ea4-9fbd-07dac4f17d5f", "b7e63ab1-9c9c-4888-9d24-d60c97f34c29", "c88d0ba0-b726-4ebc-aef7-ad7068e3eaae", "d1dcc639-060f-419e-8ef5-16d05b290692", "fdb4daf0-bfb9-43cf-ac7f-b08ea40a435b", "fe0e4f49-0b67-415e-a0b0-abd6d5e68223"], "title": "Computing Compressed Multidimensional Skyline Cubes Efficiently", "venue": "international conference on data engineering", "year": 2007, "id": "31b99543-85d2-4528-93c0-cf8d726e845d"}
{"abstract": "There is a huge wealth of sequence data available, for example, customer purchase histories, program execution traces, DNA, and protein sequences. Analyzing this wealth of data to mine important knowledge is certainly a worthwhile goal.In this paper, as a step forward to analyzing patterns in sequences, we introduce the problem of mining closed repetitive gapped subsequences and propose efficient solutions. Given a database of sequences where each sequence is an ordered list of events, the pattern we would like to mine is called repetitive gapped subsequence, which is a subsequence (possibly with gaps between two successive events within it) of some sequences in the database. We introduce the concept of repetitive support to measure how frequently a pattern repeats in the database. Different from the sequential pattern mining problem, repetitive support captures not only repetitions of a pattern in different sequences but also the repetitions within a sequence. Given a userspecified support threshold min_sup, we study finding the set of all patterns with repetitive support no less than min_sup. To obtain a compact yet complete result set and improve the efficiency, we also study finding closed patterns. Efficient mining algorithms to find the complete set of desired patterns are proposed based on the idea of instance growth. Our performance study on various datasets shows the efficiency of our approach. A case study is also performed to show the utility of our approach.", "authors": ["Bolin Ding", "David Lo", "Jiawei Han", "Siau-Cheng Khoo"], "references": ["3682b156-85e4-4eca-940f-abe15a06f9be", "43752949-5f05-4eda-b276-d5743770a9c5", "54fe2662-f4fe-4b27-903b-c9c84b1dc732", "58bde0a6-18ff-4d37-b4c2-f877f69d3e49", "656bea30-cb73-446c-82a5-c0e61682e437", "6843c07c-43aa-4db2-9387-0315379fd25e", "6be61ecd-5d2c-4ab5-961b-ce471736123d", "77de4794-bac0-414c-851b-42516c49804f", "87a0c047-1833-4264-a7a6-7a3cc8d8b382", "8cd37543-04cc-4b7e-bd2a-84682180196d", "a37bac2e-5ffb-4607-b163-c26d23d30af6", "a8570eaa-fdc7-4803-b37f-67c2fee0e91f", "c9b05538-7ed2-48a2-b969-62f1adbb04b2", "cb47b9ec-f611-4ead-a41d-616543bc6fa3", "d1c93534-82a5-41fa-a5fa-9d18f5c2577f", "d3cf363e-22c0-46e1-be9c-31fe0037b5c5"], "title": "Efficient Mining of Closed Repetitive Gapped Subsequences from a Sequence Database", "venue": "international conference on data engineering", "year": 2009, "id": "32821332-fd22-4418-8cab-79d88fbe3e37"}
{"abstract": "Detecting clusters or communities in large real-world graphs such as large social or information networks is a problem of considerable interest. In practice, one typically chooses an objective function that captures the intuition of a network cluster as set of nodes with better internal connectivity than external connectivity, and then one applies approximation algorithms or heuristics to extract sets of nodes that are related to the objective function and that \"look like\" good communities for the application of interest.   In this paper, we explore a range of network community detection methods in order to compare them and to understand their relative performance and the systematic biases in the clusters they identify. We evaluate several common objective functions that are used to formalize the notion of a network community, and we examine several different classes of approximation algorithms that aim to optimize such objective functions. In addition, rather than simply fixing an objective and asking for an approximation to the best cluster of any size, we consider a size-resolved version of the optimization problem. Considering community quality as a function of its size provides a much finer lens with which to examine community detection algorithms, since objective functions and approximation algorithms often have non-obvious size-dependent behavior.", "authors": ["Jure Leskovec", "Kevin J.

{"abstract": "Efficiently and accurately searching for similarities among time series and discovering interesting patterns is an important and non-trivial problem. In this paper, we introduce a new representation of time series, the multiresolution vector quantized (MVQ) approximation, along with a new distance function. The novelty of MVQ is that it keeps both local and global information about the original time series in a hierarchical mechanism, processing the original time series at multiple resolutions. Moreover, the proposed representation is symbolic employing key subsequences and potentially allows the application of text-based retrieval techniques into the similarity analysis of time series. The proposed method is fast and scales linearly with the size of database and the dimensionality. Contrary to the vast majority in the literature that uses the Euclidean distance, MVQ uses a multi-resolution/hierarchical distance function. We performed experiments with real and synthetic data. The proposed distance function consistently outperforms all the major competitors (Euclidean, dynamic time warping, piecewise aggregate approximation) achieving up to 20% better precision/recall and clustering accuracy on the tested datasets.", "authors": ["Vasileios Megalooikonomou", "Qiang Wang", "Guo Li", "Christos Faloutsos"], "references": ["00806be4-7a89-485a-96c6-d75d4d5a2cfb", "069c18bf-ad5e-4886-b728-e7acd85fbdf1", "111d4c33-a2e8-4ae8-91c9-c173f9691c65", "184b5da0-eab0-4fa8-bb9f-360b52296e81", "222b7fe5-52ff-4aa2-837b-756d59786ab6", "2663d978-9596-4c7c-bf06-14f80ecf46a3", "31879152-8832-45c2-9704-7550b24ef862", "33834a31-132a-409b-b646-c8918a85afb0", "459e5091-bbe1-4cb2-b41e-60b73bfc9b46", "48e52006-4359-496b-9fc7-6caa584af561", "6c5e1d10-bd51-4ac6-83f8-b74efec751b2", "75c3b543-f4b7-42d7-85ca-e7689dfa030a", "78153618-a168-4e43-95d7-0bc0550168e2", "8198a804-e67e-4371-9eef-3018cb751ef1", "8d99dd9a-2faf-4526-a071-4992a637dd32", "a39d5192-6c0e-4fd7-bfd4-fd30b645eb35", "a6924f36-df5e-4a56-a0dd-5ddbe6138633", "bd4fff86-10b0-4989-9a7b-52b00c870ca3", "c8345f84-a2e5-4085-b73d-d529f20fd5a1", "d4db8031-bfdd-470c-a160-b0715b3861e0", "e530b14c-dff5-4eea-9441-96caa9ff847f"], "title": "A multiresolution symbolic representation of time series", "venue": "international conference on data engineering", "year": 2005, "id": "33990428-8cba-4a79-b61e-47aec6268038"}

{"abstract": "Learning to rank is an important area at the interface of machine learning, information retrieval and Web search. The central challenge in optimizing various measures of ranking loss is that the objectives tend to be non-convex and discontinuous. To make such functions amenable to gradient based optimization procedures one needs to design clever bounds. In recent years, boosting, neural networks, support vector machines, and many other techniques have been applied. However, there is little work on directly modeling a conditional probability Pr(y|x_q) where y is a permutation of the documents to be ranked and x_q represents their feature vectors with respect to a query q. A major reason is that the space of y is huge: n! if n documents must be ranked. We first propose an intuitive and appealing expected loss minimization objective, and give an efficient shortcut to evaluate it despite the huge space of ys. Unfortunately, the optimization is non-convex, so we propose a convex approximation. We give a new, efficient Monte Carlo sampling method to compute the objective and gradient of this approximation, which can then be used in a quasi-Newton optimizer like LBFGS.

{"abstract": "We consider the problem of efficiently computing the skyline against the most recent N elements in a data stream seen so far. Specifically, we study the n-of-N skyline queries; that is, computing the skyline for the most recent n (/spl forall/n/spl les/N) elements. Firstly, we developed an effective pruning technique to minimize the number of elements to be kept. It can be shown that on average storing only O(log/sup d/ N) elements from the most recent N elements is sufficient to support the precise computation of all n-of-N skyline queries in a d-dimension space if the data distribution on each dimension is independent. Then, a novel encoding scheme is proposed, together with efficient update techniques, for the stored elements, so that computing an n-of-N skyline query in a d-dimension space takes O(log N+s) time that is reduced to O(d log log N+s) if the data distribution is independent, where s is the number of skyline points. Thirdly, a novel trigger based technique is provided to process continuous n-of-N skyline queries with O(/spl delta/) time to update the current result per new data element and O(log s) time to update the trigger list per result change, where /spl delta/ is the number of element changes from the current result to the new result.

{"abstract": "How do real, weighted graphs change over time? What patterns, if any, do they obey? Earlier studies focus on unweighted graphs, and, with few exceptions, they focus on static snapshots. Here, we report patterns we discover on several real, weighted, time-evolving graphs.

{"abstract": "Detecting and unraveling incipient coordinated attacks on Internet resources requires a distributed network monitoring infrastructure. Such an infrastructure will have two logically distinct elements: distributed monitors that continuously collect packet and flow-level information, and a distributed query system that allows network operators to effi- ciently and rapidly access this information. We argue that, in addition to supporting other types of queries, the network monitoring query system must support multi-dimensional range queries on traffic records (flows, or aggregated flow records).

{"abstract": "How do we find patterns and anomalies, on graphs with billions of nodes and edges, which do not fit in memory? How to use parallelism for such terabyte-scale graphs? In this work, we focus on inference, which often corresponds, intuitively, to \u201cguilt by association\u201d scenarios. For example, if a person is a drug-abuser, probably its friends are so, too; if a node in a social network is of male gender, his dates are probably females. We show how to do inference on such huge graphs through our proposed HAdoop Line graph Fixed Point (Ha-Lfp), an efficient parallel algorithm for sparse billion-scale graphs, using the Hadoop platform. Our contributions include (a) the design of Ha-Lfp, observing that it corresponds to a fixed point on a line graph induced from the original graph; (b) scalability analysis, showing that our algorithm scales up well with the number of edges, as well as with the number of machines; and (c) experimental results on two private, as well as two of the largest publicly available graphs \u2014 the Web Graphs from Yahoo! (6.6 billion edges and 0.24 Tera bytes), and the Twitter graph (3.7 billion edges and 0.13 Tera bytes).

{"abstract": "Quicklinks for a website are navigational shortcuts displayed below the website homepage on a search results page, and that let the users directly jump to selected points inside the website. Since the real-estate on a search results page is constrained and valuable, picking the best set of quicklinks to maximize the benefits for a majority of the users becomes an important problem for search engines. Using user browsing trails obtained from browser toolbars, and a simple probabilistic model, we formulate the quicklink selection problem as a combinatorial optimizaton problem. We first demonstrate the hardness of the objective, and then propose an algorithm that is provably within a factor of 1-1/e of the optimal. We also propose a different algorithm that works on trees and that can find the optimal solution; unlike the previous algorithm, this algorithm can incorporate natural constraints on the set of chosen quicklinks.

{"abstract": "Social network analysis has attracted much attention in recent years. Community mining is one of the major directions in social network analysis. Most of the existing methods on community mining assume that there is only one kind of relation in the network, and moreover, the mining results are independent of the users\u2019 needs or preferences. However, in reality, there exist multiple, heterogeneous social networks, each representing a particular kind of relationship, and each kind of relationship may play a distinct role in a particular task. In this paper, we systematically analyze the problem of mining hidden communities on heterogeneous social networks. Based on the observation that different relations have different importance with respect to a certain query, we propose a new method for learning an optimal linear combination of these relations which can best meet the user\u2019s expectation.

{"abstract": "Skew is prevalent in many data sources such as IP traffic streams. To continually summarize the distribution of such data, a high-biased set of quantiles (e.g., 50th, 90th and 99th percentiles) with finer error guarantees at higher ranks (e.g., errors of 5, 1 and 0.1 percent, respectively) is more useful than uniformly distributed quantiles (e.g., 25th, 50th and 75th percentiles) with uniform error guarantees. In this paper, we address the following two problems. First, can we compute quantiles with finer error guarantees for the higher ranks of the data distribution effectively using less space and computation time than computing all quantiles uniformly at the finest error? Second, if specific quantiles and their error bounds are requested a priori, can the necessary space usage and computation time be reduced? We answer both questions in the affirmative by formalizing them as the \"high-biased\" and the \"targeted\" quantiles problems, respectively, and presenting algorithms with provable guarantees, that perform significantly better than previously known solutions for these problems. We implemented our algorithms in the Gigascope data stream management system, and evaluated alternate approaches for maintaining the relevant summary structures. Our experimental results on real and synthetic IP data streams complement our theoretical analyses, and highlight the importance of lightweight, non-blocking implementations when maintaining summary structures over highspeed data streams.", "authors": ["Graham Cormode", "Flip Korn", "S.

{"abstract": "The database research community has recently recognized the usefulness of skyline query. As an extension of existing database operator, the skyline query is valuable for multi-criteria decision making. However, current research tends to assume that the skyline operator is applied to one table which is not true for many applications on Web databases. In Web databases, tables are distributed in different sites, and a skyline query may involve attributes of multiple tables. In this paper, we address the problem of processing skyline queries on multiple tables in a distributed environment. We call the new operator skyline-join, as it is a hybrid of skyline and join operations. We propose two efficient approaches to process skyline-join queries which can significantly reduce the communication cost and processing time. Experiments are conducted and results show that our approaches are efficient for distributed skyline-join queries.", "authors": ["Dalie Sun", "Sai Wu", "Jianzhong Li", "Anthony K. H.

{"abstract": "Item exchange is becoming a popular behavior and widely supported in more and more online community systems, e. g. online games and social network web sites. Traditional manual search for possible exchange pairs is neither efficient nor effective. Automatic exchange pairing is increasingly demanding in such community systems, and potentially leading to new business opportunities. To meet the needs on item exchange in the market, each user in the system is entitled to list some items he/she no longer needs, as well as some required items he/she is seeking for. Given the values of all items, an exchange between two users is eligible if 1) they both have some unneeded items the other one wants, and 2) the exchange items from both sides are approximately of the same total value. To efficiently support exchange recommendation services, especially with frequent updates on the listed items, new data structures are proposed in this paper to maintain promising exchange pairs for each user.

{"abstract": "This paper presents MobiMix, a road network based mix-zone framework to protect location privacy of mobile users traveling on road networks. In contrast to spatial cloaking based location privacy protection, the approach in MobiMix is to break the continuity of location exposure by using mix-zones, where no applications can trace user movement. This paper makes two original contributions. First, we provide the formal analysis on the vulnerabilities of directly applying theoretical rectangle mix-zones to road networks in terms of anonymization effectiveness and attack resilience. We argue that effective mix-zones should be constructed and placed by carefully taking into consideration of multiple factors, such as the geometry of the zones, the statistical behavior of the user population, the spatial constraints on movement patterns of the users, and the temporal and spatial resolution of the location exposure. Second, we develop a suite of road network mix-zone construction methods that provide higher level of attack resilience and yield a specified lower-bound on the level of anonymity. We evaluate the MobiMix approach through extensive experiments conducted on traces produced by GTMobiSim on different scales of geographic maps. Our experiments show that MobiMix offers high level of anonymity and high level of resilience to attacks compared to existing mix-zone approaches.", "authors": ["Balaji Palanisamy", "Ling Liu"], "references": ["0f7d594a-0a0e-4171-9c6d-5f1b6c32ae10", "17702e22-9f09-442d-8f2d-536b15409aa9", "2e529346-9a1c-4519-be5c-0aff1cf1aea3", "385462c0-3ed9-49c6-9962-a060f8f3ed85", "53c8e7f8-4a02-451f-b53f-4a63ad1124bc", "7f4ffc09-0fc9-4ad5-be8e-aaea47755c50", "919625d0-5dd1-41c8-9bc8-087754ae50d2", "b4ca9e3f-d878-430d-a354-aa1731291b73", "b7149223-3a84-4c15-b860-981565c7708d", "cebd5e91-2c8b-4bf8-9237-8b33b6f638cd", "da614ddb-191e-49f8-a6a3-c3bf6bf60325", "db0b4ee1-46c8-44dc-bd4c-9fc08c037e5d", "f517581b-80da-4453-b52a-75b77359ba2b", "faac80c6-5715-4d65-abab-d56cf946e2e7", "fbf812c0-9d3d-4393-af85-95e8f939e49f"], "title": "MobiMix: Protecting location privacy with mix-zones over road networks", "venue": "international conference on data engineering", "year": 2011, "id": "44b5fcca-1c6c-424d-bac1-750dd8a1e7e9"}
{"abstract": "The application of frequent patterns in classification has demonstrated its power in recent studies. It often adopts a two-step approach: frequent pattern (or classification rule) mining followed by feature selection (or rule ranking). However, this two-step process could be computationally expensive, especially when the problem scale is large or the minimum support is low. It was observed that frequent pattern mining usually produces a huge number of \"patterns\" that could not only slow down the mining process but also make feature selection hard to complete. In this paper, we propose a direct discriminative pattern mining approach, DDPMine, to tackle the efficiency issue arising from the two-step approach. DDPMine performs a branch-and-bound search for directly mining discriminative patterns without generating the complete pattern set. Instead of selecting best patterns in a batch, we introduce a \"feature-centered\" mining approach that generates discriminative patterns sequentially on a progressively shrinking FP-tree by incrementally eliminating training instances. The instance elimination effectively reduces the problem size iteratively and expedites the mining process. Empirical results show that DDPMine achieves orders of magnitude speedup without any downgrade of classification accuracy. It outperforms the state-of-the-art associative classification methods in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.", "authors": ["Hong Cheng", "Xifeng Yan", "Jiawei Han", "Philip S.

{"abstract": "Data stream classification poses many challenges, most of which are not addressed by the state-of-the-art. We present DXMiner, which addresses four major challenges to data stream classification, namely, infinite length, concept-drift, concept-evolution, and feature-evolution. Data streams are assumed to be infinite in length, which necessitates single-pass incremental learning techniques. Concept-drift occurs in a data stream when the underlying concept changes over time. Most existing data stream classification techniques address only the infinite length and concept-drift problems. However, concept-evolution and feature- evolution are also major challenges, and these are ignored by most of the existing approaches. Concept-evolution occurs in the stream when novel classes arrive, and feature-evolution occurs when new features emerge in the stream. Our previous work addresses the concept-evolution problem in addition to addressing the infinite length and concept-drift problems. Most of the existing data stream classification techniques, including our previous work, assume that the feature space of the data points in the stream is static. This assumption may be impractical for some type of data, for example text data. DXMiner considers the dynamic nature of the feature space and provides an elegant solution for classification and novel class detection when the feature space is dynamic. We show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art stream classification techniques in classifying and detecting novel classes in real data streams.", "authors": ["Mohammad M.

High dimensionality of transaction data poses unique challenges on data privacy and data utility. On one hand, re-identification attacks tend to use a subset of items that infrequently occur in transactions, called moles. On the other hand, data mining applications typically depend on subsets of items that frequently occur in transactions, called nuggets. Thus the problem is how to eliminate all moles while retaining nuggets as much as possible. A challenge is that moles and nuggets are multi-dimensional with exponential growth and are tangled together by shared items. We present a novel and scalable solution to this problem.

{"abstract": "The application of frequent patterns in classification appeared in sporadic studies and achieved initial success in the classification of relational data, text documents and graphs. In this paper, we conduct a systematic exploration of frequent pattern-based classification, and provide solid reasons supporting this methodology. It was well known that feature combinations (patterns) could capture more underlying semantics than single features. However, inclusion of infrequent patterns may not significantly improve the accuracy due to their limited predictive power. By building a connection between pattern frequency and discriminative measures such as information gain and Fisher score, we develop a strategy to set minimum support in frequent pattern mining for generating useful patterns. Based on this strategy, coupled with a proposed feature selection algorithm, discriminative frequent patterns can be generated for building high quality classifiers. We demonstrate that the frequent pattern-based classification framework can achieve good scalability and high accuracy in classifying large datasets.

{"abstract": "Contextual advertising supports much of the Web's ecosystem today. User experience and revenue (shared by the site publisher and the ad network) depend on the relevance of the displayed ads to the page content. As with other document retrieval systems, relevance is provided by scoring the match between individual ads (documents) and the content of the page where the ads are shown (query). In this paper we show how this match can be improved significantly by augmenting the ad-page scoring function with extra parameters from a logistic regression model on the words in the pages and ads. A key property of the proposed model is that it can be mapped to standard cosine similarity matching and is suitable for efficient and scalable implementation over inverted indexes. The model parameter values are learnt from logs containing ad impressions and clicks, with shrinkage estimators being used to combat sparsity. To scale our computations to train on an extremely large training corpus consisting of several gigabytes of data, we parallelize our fitting algorithm in a Hadoop framework [10]. Experimental evaluation is provided showing improved click prediction over a holdout set of impression and click events from a large scale real-world ad placement engine. Our best model achieves a 25% lift in precision relative to a traditional information retrieval model which is based on cosine similarity, for recalling 10% of the clicks in our test data.", "authors": ["Deepayan Chakrabarti", "Deepak Agarwal", "Vanja Josifovski"], "references": ["084f441a-0b31-4275-80f5-ecdabca3486e", "28718026-0d4f-4e23-bd09-1b921792c9ee", "3dc5f909-7d68-4651-9780-52a2d4e4df5a", "59af7e25-c0ee-4af5-acea-a58dfe4ccac4", "702351ac-1e46-487c-bf41-ae43a91ae574", "aa70d058-ba2d-409f-a20e-fcf8239a069e", "c4f758d8-61a2-469b-b381-48939d62ce6c", "cb878136-2b03-4378-a7a7-39c8e0619d6a", "d5191ac1-4c8a-4dc2-aee9-ef9015840778", "f6e2963c-70f6-4b65-b28b-dd32557fb448"], "title": "Contextual advertising by combining relevance with click feedback", "venue": "international world wide web conferences", "year": 2008, "id": "48dc7cf4-3d0b-4d40-a37d-e6ce33ac8134"}
{"abstract": "Collaborative networks are a special type of social network formed by members who collectively achieve specific goals, such as fixing software bugs and resolving customers' problems. In such networks, information flow among members is driven by the tasks assigned to the network, and by the expertise of its members to complete those tasks. In this work, we analyze real-life collaborative networks to understand their common characteristics and how information is routed in these networks. Our study shows that collaborative networks exhibit significantly different properties compared with other complex networks. Collaborative networks have truncated power-law node degree distributions and other organizational constraints. Furthermore, the number of steps along which information is routed follows a truncated power-law distribution. Based on these observations, we developed a network model that can generate synthetic collaborative networks subject to certain structure constraints. Moreover, we developed a routing model that emulates task-driven information routing conducted by human beings in a collaborative network. Together, these two models can be used to study the efficiency of information routing for different types of collaborative networks -- a problem that is important in practice yet difficult to solve without the method proposed in this paper.", "authors": ["Gengxin Miao", "Shu Tao", "Winnie Cheng", "Randy Moulic", "Louise E.
